title: Overview of Entity relationship models
---

<!--
Hey Chatgpt.  I'd you to play the role of a professor teaching an undergraduate computer science course covering databases.  The course consists of several modules including: entity-relationship models, relational algebra, normal forms and normalization, and SQL.

I need your assistance developing materials for 9 20-min long lectures covering the topic of entity-relationship models. As a first step, please provide 9 high-level topics to be covered.

Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling is a conceptual framework used to represent the data structure of a database system. It involves identifying entities (objects or concepts), attributes (properties of entities), and relationships (associations between entities) within the system. ER models are typically depicted using ER diagrams, which visually represent entities as rectangles, attributes as ovals, and relationships as diamonds, connected by lines. These models are foundational in database design, helping to ensure that the database accurately reflects the real-world scenarios it is intended to represent.
