## Introduction to Entities and Attributes

Entities represent real-world objects or concepts, while attributes describe their characteristics. Understanding these concepts is crucial for effective database design.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}
- Entities are objects or things in the real world that have a distinct existence.
- Examples include a student, a course, a product, or an employee.
- Attributes are the properties or characteristics of entities.
- Each entity is represented by a set of attributes.
- Attributes describe details like the name, age, or ID of an entity.

Using graphvix, create a circular diagram with the following nodes:
- understanding requirements
- conceptual design
- logical design
- physical design
- implementation
- testing and validation
- maintenance and optimization
:::

- **Understanding Requirements:** Gathering and analyzing business requirements to define the purpose and scope of the database.
- **Conceptual Design:** Creating high-level data models, such as ER diagrams, to visualize the structure and relationships of the data.
- **Logical Design:** Translating the conceptual model into a logical structure that defines tables, fields, and relationships without concern for physical implementation.
- **Physical Design:** Deciding on the physical storage of the data, including indexing, partitioning, and optimization strategies for performance.
- **Implementation:** Actual creation of the database using SQL, setting up tables, constraints, and relationships as defined in the logical and physical design stages.
- **Testing and Validation:** Ensuring the database meets the requirements through testing, validation, and adjustments as necessary.
- **Maintenance and Optimization:** Ongoing tuning and maintenance to ensure the database performs efficiently and scales with business needs.

*Database design is a multi-step process that ensures a robust, scalable, and efficient database system.*


## Understanding Requirements {.slide-template-bullet-walk}

The first step in database design is understanding the data needs and requirements. This phase ensures that the database aligns with business goals and user needs.
