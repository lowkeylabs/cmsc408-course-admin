## Introduction to Entities and Attributes

Entities represent real-world objects or concepts, while attributes describe their characteristics. Understanding these concepts is crucial for effective database design.

::: {.guide-block-left}
- Entities are objects or things in the real world that have a distinct existence.
- Examples include a student, a course, a product, or an employee.
- Attributes are the properties or characteristics of entities.
- Each entity is represented by a set of attributes.
- Attributes describe details like the name, age, or ID of an entity.

In this module, we explore the relationship between relational algebra and SQL, two fundamental languages in the world of relational databases. Relational algebra provides a theoretical, procedural framework for database queries, while SQL is a practical, declarative language used in modern database systems. By examining how relational algebra operations map to SQL and understanding the differences between procedural and declarative approaches, students will gain a deeper understanding of query execution. This comparison will also highlight practical examples of using both languages to perform essential database operations.

## Mapping Relational Algebra Operations to SQL

Relational algebra forms the theoretical foundation for SQL. Understanding the mapping between these two is key to mastering query writing in relational databases.

::: {.guide-block-left}
- Relational algebra is a procedural query language, while SQL is declarative.
- Selection in relational algebra maps to the `WHERE` clause in SQL.
- Projection in relational algebra is equivalent to the `SELECT` clause in SQL.
- Joins in SQL are the direct mapping of join operations in relational algebra.
- Set operations like union and intersection are handled similarly in both, but SQL uses keywords like `UNION` and `INTERSECT`.
:::
::: {.guide-block-right}
:::

*Mastering the mapping helps in transitioning between theory and practical implementations.*

## Procedural vs Declarative Query Languages

Relational algebra and SQL differ in how they express queries: one is procedural, while the other is declarative. This distinction affects how queries are structured and optimized.

::: {.guide-block-left}
- Procedural languages like relational algebra require specifying how to retrieve the data.
- Declarative languages like SQL focus on what data to retrieve, leaving optimization to the system.
- Relational algebra is more precise but less flexible for large, complex queries.
- SQL abstracts away implementation details, making it easier to write high-level queries.
- SQL queries can often be optimized by the DBMS for better performance.
:::
::: {.guide-block-right}
:::

*The main difference between procedural and declarative languages lies in how they approach data retrieval.*

## Selection and Projection Mapping

Selection and projection are core operations in relational algebra, and they map directly to SQL clauses that form the basis of any query.

::: {.guide-block-left}
- In relational algebra, selection filters rows based on conditions.
- SQL's `WHERE` clause directly maps to relational algebra’s selection operation.
- Projection retrieves only the specified columns in relational algebra.
- SQL uses the `SELECT` clause for projection, where specific columns are listed.
- Combining `SELECT` and `WHERE` in SQL reflects both projection and selection in relational algebra.
:::
::: {.guide-block-right}
:::

*Selection and projection are basic operations that appear in nearly every SQL query.*

## Union and Intersection in SQL

Relational algebra uses set theory, and its set operations have clear parallels in SQL. Understanding these helps in writing queries that combine datasets.

::: {.guide-block-left}
- `UNION` in SQL corresponds directly to the union operation in relational algebra.
- `INTERSECT` in SQL performs the intersection, returning rows common to both datasets.
- SQL requires datasets to have the same schema when performing set operations.
- SQL also supports `EXCEPT` for set difference, similar to relational algebra.
- Set operations are useful for combining results from multiple queries.
:::
::: {.guide-block-right}
:::

*Set operations in SQL mirror those in relational algebra, but with some syntax restrictions.*

## Joins: Relational Algebra vs SQL

Join operations are critical in both relational algebra and SQL, though they differ slightly in terms of syntax and application.

::: {.guide-block-left}
- SQL's `INNER JOIN` maps to the natural join in relational algebra.
- Relational algebra defines theta joins, which can be written as `JOIN ON` in SQL.
- SQL supports `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`, which correspond to outer joins in relational algebra.
- Cross joins in SQL represent the Cartesian product of two relations.
- Joins are used to combine related data from different tables or relations.
:::
::: {.guide-block-right}
:::

*Joins are essential for combining data from multiple sources, both in relational algebra and SQL.*

## Natural Join vs SQL’s INNER JOIN

While the natural join and `INNER JOIN` are conceptually similar, their implementations can lead to different results based on how they handle common attributes.

::: {.guide-block-left}
- A natural join in relational algebra automatically joins on common attributes.
- In SQL, the `INNER JOIN` requires specifying the join condition using the `ON` clause.
- Natural joins can sometimes lead to unintended results if there are many common attributes.
- SQL’s `INNER JOIN` provides more control over the join conditions.
- Natural joins are rarely used in practice, while `INNER JOIN` is common.
:::
::: {.guide-block-right}
:::

*While both operations combine data, SQL’s `INNER JOIN` offers more flexibility and control.*

## Differences Between Relational Algebra and SQL Syntax

SQL syntax provides more expressiveness and user-friendliness than relational algebra, but with some trade-offs in terms of precision and control.

::: {.guide-block-left}
- Relational algebra uses operators like σ (selection) and π (projection), while SQL uses more readable keywords like `SELECT` and `WHERE`.
- SQL allows for complex subqueries and nested queries, unlike relational algebra.
- SQL includes built-in functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `AVG`, which are not part of relational algebra.
- SQL supports data definition and manipulation, whereas relational algebra focuses only on queries.
- Relational algebra is better suited for theoretical discussions and algorithm development.
:::
::: {.guide-block-right}
:::

*SQL offers a more practical syntax for database interaction, while relational algebra remains more theoretical.*

## Practical Examples: Selection and Projection

Applying relational algebra concepts in SQL can be done by writing basic queries using selection and projection to retrieve and filter data.

::: {.guide-block-left}
- Example: Selecting all customers from a specific city in relational algebra: σ(city = 'New York')(Customers).
- SQL equivalent: `SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE city = 'New York';`.
- Projecting customer names in relational algebra: π(name)(Customers).
- SQL equivalent: `SELECT name FROM Customers;`.
- SQL allows combining selection and projection in a single query.
:::
::: {.guide-block-right}
:::

*Simple SQL queries often directly map to equivalent relational algebra operations.*

## Subqueries: SQL vs Relational Algebra

SQL supports subqueries, allowing queries within queries. These constructs are not native to relational algebra, but can be expressed through multiple steps.

::: {.guide-block-left}
- SQL subqueries are often written within the `SELECT`, `WHERE`, or `FROM` clauses.
- Example: `SELECT name FROM Employees WHERE dept_id IN (SELECT dept_id FROM Departments WHERE name = 'Sales');`.
- In relational algebra, this would require separate steps: selection, projection, and join operations.
- Subqueries in SQL improve readability and modularity.
- Subqueries can also be correlated, where the inner query depends on the outer query.
:::
::: {.guide-block-right}
:::

*Subqueries offer a powerful way to write more concise and modular SQL queries.*

## Why Understanding Both Is Important

While SQL is widely used in practice, understanding relational algebra provides deeper insight into query processing and optimization.

::: {.guide-block-left}
- SQL is the practical language for interacting with relational databases.
- Relational algebra provides the theoretical foundation for SQL.
- Understanding relational algebra helps in query optimization and designing efficient databases.
- Some advanced queries in SQL can be better understood by breaking them down into relational algebra steps.
- Query execution plans in SQL are based on relational algebra operations.
:::
::: {.guide-block-right}
:::

*Knowledge of both relational algebra and SQL is critical for mastering database design and query optimization.*
