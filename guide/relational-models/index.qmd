title: Overview of Entity relationship models
---

<!--
Hey Chatgpt.  I'd you to play the role of a professor teaching an undergraduate computer science course covering databases.  The course consists of several modules including: entity-relationship models, relational model and relational algebra, normal forms and normalization, and SQL.

I need your assistance developing materials for 9 20-min long lectures covering the topic of the relational model and relational algebra. As a first step, please provide 9 high-level topics to be covered.

I'd like your response carefully formatted using markdown.  Here is my prescribed format template:
-example-begin-
1. [**Overview of Database Design**](overview-of-database-design.qmd)
   - Definition and purpose of database design.
   - Overview of key design phases.
   - Ensuring data integrity, scalability, and alignment with business goals.
-example-end-

The relational model and relational algebra form the foundation of modern relational databases, providing a framework for data organization and manipulation. These modules will introduce students to the core concepts of the relational model, including relations, keys, and schemas, and guide them through the essential operations of relational algebra. By the end of this series, students will gain the skills to perform complex queries and understand the practical applications of relational databases in real-world scenarios.
