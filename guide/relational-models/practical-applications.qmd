1. Each slide should lead off with 2 sentences summarizing the content of the slide.
1. Each slide should contain 5-7 bullets. The bullets should be included in a special pandoc markdown format as shown below.
1. Each slide should end with an unbolded sentence summarizing the slide.

Below is an example of the formatting:

## Introduction to Entities and Attributes

Entities represent real-world objects or concepts, while attributes describe their characteristics. Understanding these concepts is crucial for effective database design.

::: {.guide-block-left}
- Entities are objects or things in the real world that have a distinct existence.
- Examples include a student, a course, a product, or an employee.
- Attributes are the properties or characteristics of entities.
- Each entity is represented by a set of attributes.
- Attributes describe details like the name, age, or ID of an entity.
