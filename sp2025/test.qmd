# Direct include

The graphviz plot below is generated from code in an *include* metacode.  The block below works as expected.

{{< include "_sample.qmd" >}}


# Include from python

The next plot is not being redered properly.  Rather than a figure, it's displaying the contents of the graphviz diagram as code.


```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis

print('\n\n{{< include "_sample.qmd" >}}')

```
