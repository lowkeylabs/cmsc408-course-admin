Quiz title: Quiz 4 - Normalization - Blooms 5, Evaluate.
Quiz description: This quiz focuses on normalization.

1. Evaluating the following relation R(A, B, C, D) with FDs: A->B, BC->D. Which of these FDs is extraneous?

a) A->B
... Incorrect. Removing A->B would lose the ability to determine B from A.
b) BC->A
... Incorrect. This FD is not even provided in the given set.
*c) BC->D
... CORRECT. BC->D is extraneous because D can be determined via A->B and transitivity.
d) B->C
... Incorrect. This FD is not even provided in the given set.



2. Given that X is a set of attributes and F is a set of functional dependencies, which statement correctly evaluates the closure X+ under F?

a) X+ includes all attributes functionally determined by X.
... Incorrect. This is a basic description of closure, not an evaluation of its properties.
b) X+ is the set of attributes not functionally determined by X.
... Incorrect. This is the opposite of the definition of closure.
*c) If Y is a subset of X+, then X functionally determines Y.
... CORRECT. By definition of closure, if Y is in the closure of X, then X functionally determines Y.
d) X+ always equals the set of all attributes in the relation.
... Incorrect. X+ contains all attributes determinable by X, not necessarily all attributes.



3. Evaluating the concept of Canonical Cover, which of these is TRUE regarding its properties?

a) Canonical Cover is a set of all possible functional dependencies.
... Incorrect. Canonical Cover isn't about all possible FDs but the minimal representation.
*b) If G is a canonical cover for F, then G is equivalent to F but with redundant FDs removed.
... CORRECT. A canonical cover is equivalent to F but without extraneous attributes.
c) Canonical Cover ensures every FD has a right-hand side with multiple attributes.
... Incorrect. In Canonical Cover, every FD's right-hand side has only one attribute.
d) G is a canonical cover for F if they both have the same number of FDs.
... Incorrect. Equivalence isn't based on the number of FDs, but on their information.



4. In the context of denormalization, which of the following is the primary evaluation point for implementing it?

a) To convert a database from 1NF to 2NF.
... Incorrect. Denormalization usually involves moving away from higher normal forms.
*b) To enhance query performance at the potential cost of data redundancy.
... CORRECT. Denormalization is often done for performance reasons, even if it leads to redundancy.
c) To ensure data integrity and minimize redundancy.
... Incorrect. Denormalization can introduce redundancy.
d) To reduce the number of relations in a database.
... Incorrect. Denormalization merges tables, but the main goal is not to reduce relation count.




6. When assessing FD preservation, why is it crucial for database decomposition?

a) It ensures that FDs are distributed evenly across tables.
... Incorrect. The goal isn't even distribution but ensuring no FDs are lost.
*b) It maintains the ability to check constraints based on original FDs post decomposition.
... CORRECT. Preservation ensures we can still enforce original constraints after decomposition.
c) It ensures that every attribute has its own table.
... Incorrect. This doesn't capture the essence of FD preservation.
d) It reduces the number of FDs in the database.
... Incorrect. The goal isn't to reduce FDs but to ensure none are lost in decomposition.



7. Evaluating the use of normalization, which scenario primarily necessitates normalization to 3NF?

a) To handle multi-valued dependencies.
... Incorrect. MVDs are addressed by 4NF.
b) To ensure every relation has a primary key.
... Incorrect. Having a primary key is a requirement of 1NF.
*c) To eliminate transitive dependencies on the primary key.
... CORRECT. 3NF specifically addresses this issue.
d) To decompose relations so they can be joined without loss.
... Incorrect. This speaks more to the property of lossless join.



8. When evaluating BCNF in comparison to 3NF, which statement correctly reflects their relationship?

a) Every relation in 3NF is also in BCNF.
... Incorrect. While many relations in 3NF are in BCNF, not all are.
b) BCNF and 3NF are always equivalent.
... Incorrect. They are distinct normal forms.
*c) Every relation in BCNF is also in 3NF, but not vice versa.
... CORRECT. BCNF is a stricter version of 3NF.
d) 3NF addresses join dependencies, while BCNF doesn't.
... Incorrect. Join dependencies are primarily addressed by 5NF.



10. Evaluating the normalization process, which of the following is an implication of not achieving higher normal forms like BCNF or 4NF?

a) It ensures the database will have no data redundancy.
... Incorrect. Higher normal forms aim to reduce redundancy, not lower ones.
*b) The database may face certain types of anomalies like insertion, deletion, or update anomalies.
... CORRECT. Failure to achieve higher normal forms can lead to these anomalies.
c) All relations will be devoid of primary keys.
... Incorrect. Presence of primary keys is not directly tied to higher normal forms.
d) Multi-valued dependencies will be handled effectively.
... Incorrect. MVDs are specifically addressed by 4NF.


11. Which of the following evaluations regarding the Relational Model is accurate?

a) The relational model disregards the importance of relationships between tables.
... Incorrect. The essence of the relational model is to model data and its relationships.
*b) The relational model uses tables (relations) to represent data and relationships.
... CORRECT. This is the fundamental structure of the relational model.
c) Every table in the relational model must have multi-valued attributes.
... Incorrect. This is not a requirement; in fact, multi-valued attributes break 1NF.
d) Relationships in the relational model are represented using primary-foreign key pairs in separate tables.
... Incorrect. Relationships are modeled using primary-foreign key pairs, but not necessarily in separate tables.



12. Evaluating the process of determining the closure of a set of attributes, which statement is accurate?

a) Closure always results in the smallest set of attributes that can be determined.
... Incorrect. Closure results in all determinable attributes, not the smallest set.
b) The closure of an attribute set never includes the attributes themselves.
... Incorrect. The set itself is always part of its closure.
*c) Computing the closure helps in determining superkeys for a relation.
... CORRECT. By determining what an attribute set can functionally determine, one can identify superkeys.
d) The closure is a way to determine extraneous attributes.
... Incorrect. Closure determines determinable attributes, not extraneous ones.



13. Which of the following evaluations regarding Canonical Cover is incorrect?

a) Canonical cover aids in minimizing redundancy in functional dependencies.
... Incorrect. This statement is accurate.
b) Two equivalent sets of functional dependencies can have distinct canonical covers.
... Incorrect. They should have the same canonical cover if truly equivalent.
*c) Canonical cover requires that every functional dependency has a left-hand side with multiple attributes.
... CORRECT. This statement is false; the left-hand side can have a single attribute.
d) Canonical covers help in the normalization process.
... Incorrect. This statement is accurate, as canonical covers assist in ensuring minimal representation of FDs.



14. Given a relational database, which evaluation regarding denormalization is true?

a) Denormalization should always be the first step in designing databases.
... Incorrect. Usually, databases are normalized first, and denormalization is considered based on specific needs.
b) Denormalization is the process of converting a database to 1NF.
... Incorrect. 1NF is a normalization process, not denormalization.
*c) Denormalization can improve read performance but might compromise write efficiency.
... CORRECT. While faster reads might be achieved due to reduced joins, updates can become more complex due to redundancy.
d) Denormalization eliminates the need for primary and foreign keys.
... Incorrect. Keys can still be present in a denormalized database.



15. Evaluating the hierarchy of normal forms, which of these is a correct observation?

a) BCNF is always considered weaker than 3NF.
... Incorrect. BCNF is actually stricter than 3NF.
*b) Every table in 2NF is also in 1NF, but the reverse is not always true.
... CORRECT. 2NF implies 1NF, but a table in 1NF might not be in 2NF.
c) 4NF is primarily focused on eliminating partial dependencies.
... Incorrect. That's the primary concern of 2NF.
d) 3NF and BCNF are essentially the same and can be used interchangeably.
... Incorrect. While closely related, they address different types of anomalies.



16. Which of the following best evaluates the need for Functional Dependency Preservation during decomposition?

a) It's only necessary when decomposing to 1NF.
... Incorrect. FD preservation is crucial for higher normal forms, not just 1NF.
b) It ensures that data redundancy is minimized after decomposition.
... Incorrect. FD preservation doesn't directly deal with redundancy.
*c) It ensures that original constraints can still be enforced after decomposition.
... CORRECT. By preserving FDs, we maintain the ability to check original constraints.
d) It ensures all decomposed tables are in 3NF.
... Incorrect. FD preservation doesn't directly guarantee a specific normal form.



18. Evaluating the normalization process, which of the following is a correct observation about 2NF?

a) 2NF is primarily concerned with removing all types of data redundancy.
... Incorrect. 2NF focuses specifically on partial dependencies.
b) 2NF is weaker than 1NF.
... Incorrect. 2NF implies 1NF and is stricter.
*c) For a relation to be in 2NF, it must first satisfy the requirements of 1NF and have no partial dependencies.
... CORRECT. This correctly describes the requirements of 2NF.
d) 2NF focuses on multi-valued dependencies.
... Incorrect. MVDs are the concern of 4NF, not 2NF.



19. In terms of Functional Dependency Preservation, which evaluation is true?

a) It ensures that all attributes are part of the primary key.
... Incorrect. FD preservation doesn't necessarily ensure this.
b) It's primarily concerned with ensuring data redundancy.
... Incorrect. FD preservation focuses on maintaining original FDs, not on redundancy.
*c) A lossless join decomposition that doesn't preserve FDs might require more expensive queries to enforce constraints.
... CORRECT. Without FD preservation, more complex joins might be required to enforce original constraints.
d) It ensures all functional dependencies have single attribute right-hand sides.
... Incorrect. FD preservation doesn't change the structure of FDs.
