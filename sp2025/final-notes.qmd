# Discussion on semester-long project

Reinforce that the semester-long project parallels the course.  Skills in the course will map to the deliverables
of the semester-long project.  If you keep up with the homework, you'll be prepared to complete the deliverables of the project.

The semester-long-project is a semester-long project, not a day-long or week-long project.  Don't delay and put it off until
the end of the term.  You won't enjoy life.

The semester-long project requires that YOU learn NEW skills NOT covered by the instructor in the class.  This is an important
learning outcome of our computer science program:  graduates are able to learn and use a new technology on their own. (get correct ABET language here.)

As part of the semester-long project, students will develop and deploy a FULL-STACK web-based database application.  We'll be learning the database stuff in class.  The STUDENT TEAMS are REQUIRED to TEACH THEMSELVES the front-end stuff.


Here is a **revised table of full-stack technologies organized by decade**, now **including XAMPP and LAMP**, along with a column indicating the **current relevance** or "vibe" of each stack. This version helps students see where technologies sit historically, what they were used for, and how modern alternatives have evolved.

### Prompt:

I'm teaching a database class where students are building full-stack applications. I want a comprehensive table that organizes full-stack technologies by **decade**, showing:

- Typical **stacks** (e.g., LAMP, XAMPP, MERN, Supabase + Next.js)
- The **database**, **backend**, **frontend**, and **deployment/infra** components of each stack
- A column for **vibe or relevance today** (e.g., "modern", "dated", "experimental")
- Include both **legacy stacks** like LAMP/XAMPP and **modern stacks** like Supabase, Vercel, Firebase, Bun, Deno, etc.

Also include:
- A follow-up summary table comparing XAMPP and LAMP
- A recommendation section suggesting which stack types are best for different student personas (e.g., beginner, devops-inclined, modern frontend)

Format everything in well-aligned markdown tables, with clean labels and emoji status indicators (🟢 modern, 🟡 dated, 🔴 obsolete, 🧪 experimental).

# another set of recommendations

*review the recommendations - order by ease of implementation, less-steep learning curve for undergraduates in a DATABASE course, who have to implement a front end on their own with minimal guidance from professor.*

### Ranked Recommendations (Easiest to Hardest)

| Rank | Student Goal              | Recommended Stack(s)                             | Why It's a Good Fit for Students                                                                 |
|------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Easy full-stack with SQL  | **Supabase + Next.js (or React)**               | 🟢 Built-in PostgreSQL, Auth, REST, optional GraphQL. <br>🟢 Great docs, live UI, minimal setup. <br>🟢 Easy to scaffold both frontend and backend. |
| 2    | Mobile-first + SQL        | **Supabase + Expo (React Native)**              | 🟢 Mobile SDKs, handles auth/storage. <br>🟡 Slightly more complex than web. <br>🟢 Works well for teams wanting an app-like experience. |
| 3    | Simple backend + SQL      | **Django + PostgreSQL**                         | 🟢 Admin panel out-of-the-box. <br>🟡 Needs some setup, but great structure and ORM. <br>🟡 Templated frontend may feel dated unless React is added. |
| 4    | Fully customizable VPS    | **Flask + PostgreSQL on AWS Lightsail**         | 🟡 Teaches full control (SSH, server setup). <br>🔴 Requires Linux skills, deploy pain points. <br>🟡 Good if guided by tutorials. |
| 5    | Modern SQL + JS           | **PlanetScale + Vite + React**                  | 🟢 Very modern. <br>🟡 PlanetScale uses MySQL with branching and requires Git integration. <br>🟡 GraphQL needs external layer. |
| 6    | Cutting-edge exploration  | **Deno + Fresh / Bun + SQLite**                 | 🧪 Very fast, modern DX. <br>🔴 Thin docs, small community. <br>🔴 Not good for solo learners without web experience. |


### Why Firebase, XAMPP, and LAMP Were Omitted

| Stack       | Reason for Exclusion from Top List                         |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Firebase**| ❌ Not SQL-based. Firestore and RTDB are NoSQL.             |
| **XAMPP**   | 🟡 Teaches old PHP/MySQL, but lacks modern dev practices.   |
| **LAMP**    | 🟡 SQL-compatible but dated. Encourages poor frontend/backend separation. |


### Instructor Summary

- **Best All-Around Stack for Undergrads**:  
  ✅ **Supabase + Next.js** — combines modern frontend with easy backend and real SQL. Minimal setup, strong docs, and fits the real-world skills students will use.

- **Best for Ambitious or Experienced Teams**:  
  🔧 **PlanetScale + React** or **Flask + PostgreSQL on AWS Lightsail** — offer full control but require stronger Git, CLI, and deployment skills.

- **Best for Mobile Apps**:  
  📱 **Supabase + Expo** — gives mobile-first experience with authentication and SQL out of the box.

- **Avoid** NoSQL platforms like Firebase unless you're teaching polyglot persistence or client-side–only apps.

- **Encourage** students to document how they connect their frontend to SQL-based queries, especially if they use GraphQL or REST APIs.


# course redesign

*I'm teaching ER diagrams, relational algebra, normalization and SQL in a 15-week course. Concurrently, students are working on an independent full-stack project where they need to implement a CRUD front end using the technology of their choice.  I pace the lectures so that by the end of week 13 students have a working back-end.  But it is their responsibility to select a front-end technology and implement it concurrently.  Your thoughts?*

That’s a strong, well-scaffolded design—you're anchoring students in **core database principles (ER, RA, NF, SQL)** while giving them **autonomy** and **real-world experience** in building a full-stack app. You're also giving them **enough backend grounding** by Week 13 to ensure the front-end work has substance behind it.

Here are my thoughts and suggestions to maximize learning and reduce pitfalls:

---

## ✅ Strengths of Your Approach

| Area                            | Strength                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Theory-practice integration** | Students don’t just memorize SQL—they apply it to a real app with CRUD operations.                             |
| **Project realism**             | Mirrors real-world scenarios: backend-first, frontend concurrency, tech choice autonomy.                       |
| **Timing**                      | Week 13 is a good deadline for a database-backed backend; gives 2 weeks to polish front-end.                   |
| **Skill exposure**              | Students learn ER modeling, normalization, SQL—and must figure out how to use APIs or ORM tools to power a UI. |

---

## ⚠️ Risks to Mitigate

| Risk                               | Recommendation                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend overwhelm**             | Provide a curated list of front-end starter stacks (React + Vite, Next.js, Astro, etc.) with simple examples.              |
| **API/data integration confusion** | Introduce API design and GraphQL/REST concepts lightly by mid-semester (around Weeks 7–9).                                 |
| **Disconnect from DB schema**      | Encourage students to generate their front-end from their actual schema (via Swagger, Supabase, or GraphQL introspection). |
| **Late panic**                     | Midway milestone: require a basic front-end skeleton (even static pages with buttons) by Week 9 or 10.                     |

---

## 🗓️ Suggested Timeline Overlay (15 Weeks)

| Week  | Core Lecture Topic             | Project Recommendation                             |
| ----- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1–2   | ER modeling                    | Design project topic + initial ERD                 |
| 3–4   | Relational model & constraints | Translate ERD to relational schema                 |
| 5–6   | Relational algebra             | Assign queries to model key use cases              |
| 7–8   | Normalization                  | Refine schema, introduce REST vs GraphQL           |
| 9     | SQL SELECT + Aggregation       | Midpoint: front-end mockup + API plan due          |
| 10–11 | SQL JOINs, Subqueries          | Begin implementing frontend form → API → DB        |
| 12–13 | SQL INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE     | Full backend working (CRUD API + database tested)  |
| 14    | Transactions, views, indexes   | Frontend final polish + integration                |
| 15    | Capstone demo                  | Present full app, highlight ERD → DB → UI workflow |

---

## 🧩 Support Suggestions

* ✅ Offer **1–3 frontend templates** (e.g., Supabase + Next.js, Django + Bootstrap, Vite + React) that students can fork
* ✅ Provide a **sample repo with REST or GraphQL** endpoints they can experiment against early
* ✅ Use class time for **low-stakes design reviews** (e.g., "Show your form flow and where it maps to SQL")

---

## 📚 Teaching Philosophy Bonus

You're implicitly teaching students the **Double Diamond** of product design:

> Discover (ERD/Modeling) → Define (Schema) → Develop (API/backend) → Deliver (Frontend UX)

This helps them understand how **database theory enables real user interaction**, and gives them a **portfolio-worthy deliverable** with practical relevance.
