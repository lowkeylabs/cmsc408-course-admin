<p>I regularly get the same questions over and over. I assembled these suggestions in one place designed to <strong>SAVE YOU HOURS™!</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>ALL HOMEWORKS ARE ACCEPTED LATE!</strong> - You learn databases by doing databases. I want you to do all the homework so you learn databases! I realize that life happens - so when it does <em>RELAX.</em> Do what you need to do and then <em>FINISH YOUR HOMEWORK!</em> Don’t get too far behind; it’s hard to catch up!</p>
<p><em>Sheesh, Dr.&nbsp;Leonard, what are you thinking?</em> I’m glad you asked! <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2024.1324506/full">This is what I’m thinking!</a></p>
<p><strong>LOOK AT ALL THE FILES IN THE HOMEWORK SCAFFOLDS!</strong> - I don’t drop files into the scaffold GitHub repos to take up room. The support files (anything not named <code>report.qmd</code> or <code>report.html</code>) often provide very useful examples for completing the homework. Why reinvent the wheel? Investigate what I provide, and you may find answers to all your questions and <em>SAVE YOU HOURS™.</em></p>
<p><strong>WATCH THE LECTURES!</strong> - It’s clear from both the Canvas statistics AND the questions I receive on the weekends that over half of you are not watching the lectures. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qdfMYFl0Ic" class="inline_disabled" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Try it - you’ll like it!</a> In each lecture, I spend time at the beginning talking about the homework assignments and comment on questions I’ve been receiving from others in the class. Heck, I may even provide a tip or trick that can <em>SAVE YOU HOURS™.</em></p>
<p>The lectures are organized and follow a specific rhythm - on the first slide I provide announcements AND a list of topics for the lecture. Each topic matches slide separators in the video - you can fast-forward ahead to find where the topic starts. I try to discuss homeworks at the beginning to make the conversation easier to find.</p>
<p><strong>CHECK OUT THE RESOURCES!</strong> - Each week I spend a lot of time curating <em>the perfect</em> resources for sharing on the weekly frontpage. My goal is to provide informative and sometimes entertaining sites and videos that will complement the assignments and lectures. Please spend a few minutes at least scanning them. Again, you might find a tip or trick that can <em>SAVE YOU HOURS™</em> on the homework.</p>
<p><strong>READ THE ANNOUNCEMENTS!</strong> - Please, please, please <em>READ</em> the announcements! If you encounter an issue with the homework, <em>FIRST</em> look at the announcements! My fingers are tired from telling people on Saturday and Sunday nights that the usernames and database names changed to <em>LOWERCASE!</em> Your emails to me suggested that you’d already spent hours trying to get the database to work. A quick read of the announcements may <em>SAVE YOU HOURS™!</em></p>
