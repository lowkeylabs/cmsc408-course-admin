# Direct include

The graphviz plot below is generated from code in an *include* metacode. This code properly renders the graphviz diagram.

{{< include "_sample1.qmd" >}}


# Python include

The block below *should* look like the one above.  However, the graphviz code included is not rendered, but
rather is being displayed in a code block.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis

print('\n\n{{< include "_sample1.qmd" >}}')

```

# Static include within an include

{{< include "_test1.qmd" >}}
