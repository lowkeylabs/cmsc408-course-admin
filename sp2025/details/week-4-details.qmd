### Things to do this week

```{python}
print(f"""
<b>{expand_quiz(quizzes, "Practice Quiz 2 ","practice quiz 2", url_type="anchor", target="_blank")}</b> - Get started on practice quiz 2.  This quiz focuses on relational algebra.

<b>{expand_assignment(assignments,"Deliverable 4 - Video Pitch","Deliverable 4 - Video Pitch",url_type="anchor")}</b> - You are working with your team mate(s) to refine your semester project idea, then put together a video that *pitches* your idea.  A passing grade is your OK to proceed with deliverable 5.  Up in the resources I provide an example of what this video pitch might look like.

<b>{expand_assignment(assignments,"Homework 2 - ER modeling","Homework 2 - Entity Relation Models",url_type="anchor")}</b> - Practice makes perfect!  You are getting practice creating ER diagrams from descriptions
of a databases.

<b>{expand_assignment(assignments,"Harmonize discussion 2 - Relational algebra","Discussion 2 - Relational Alg.",url_type="anchor")}</b> - A little tougher. I want to pick a relational algebra topic and then explain it in a post.  You will also be offering tips or suggestions to explanations posted by other students.
