#### Lecture update 

- Lectures on Thursday, April 24 and Tuesday, April 29 are CANCELLED.  I will be submitting course updates
via Canvas Announcements.  We will have no scheduled in-class activities.

#### End of semester checklist

It's end of the semester time! Plenty to do to ensure that you earn your best grade possible!

- [Check the gradebook](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/113813/gradebook).

	- Verify your scores and email me if you have any questions
	- Submit any missing assignments, discussions or quizzes.

- Complete the [course evaluation](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/113813/assignments/1081397). You'll get credit towards your final grade AND you'll be helping 
improve the course for the next group of students. Thank you!

Please use the Discord and the TAs as your first stop for questions.  My response time over the next week will be slow.

#### IMPORTANT

* **No late submissions will be accepted.  Midnight, April 29 is the deadline.**

* **Once Canvas closes, it's done. You've still got time to get stuff done!**
