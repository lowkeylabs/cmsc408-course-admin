<p class="lead">We're focused on CRAFTING entity-relation models!</p>

```{python}
print(f"""
{expand_page(pages,"Last week","week 2 - front page",url_type="anchor")} we introduced a TON of material
on entity-relation modeling. We've got a <a href="https://lowkeylabs.github.io/cmsc408-course-admin/guide/er-models/">study guide</a> that summarizes the material, too.


This week we're building practice creating entition-relation diagrams.  There are two focii - getting practice with the tools (graphviz and mermaid), and getting practice translating real world objects into entity-relation
models.

```

## Things you should be doing this week

```{python}
print(f"""
At this point, you should have a team for the {expand_page(pages,"Semester-long project","resource-course-project",url_type="anchor")}.

What kind of database are you going to build? In {expand_assignment(assignments,"Deliverable 3","Deliverable 3 - Ideation",url_type="anchor")} you'll be working with your teammates on Harmonize to kick around ideas.  A
key learning objective for this assignment is learning to work as part of a team to define and accomplish
common goals.

Once you have your project <em>generally scoped</em>, you need to pitch your idea to me in {expand_assignment(assignments,"Deliverable 4","Deliverable 4 - video pitch",url_type="anchor")}.  You make a video (using zoom or whatever) and submit it to me for review.  <b>I MUST APPROVE</b> all topics prior to you moving forward.
This approval comes in the form of a passing grade for deliverable 4.

While all this project stuff is happening, there is the perfunctory {expand_assignment(assignments,"Homework 2","Homework 2 - Entity Relation Models",url_type="anchor")} on ER Models. It is here (in this assignment)
that you'll get lots of practice on ER Modeling.

```

## Things that you should have already completed

Don't get too far behind!

```{python}
print(f"""
1. <b>Got your partner for the semester project?</b> - {expand_assignment(assignments,"Deliverable 1","Deliverable 1 - Intros",url_type="anchor")} was designed to help you meet potential partners, {expand_assignment(assignments,"Deliverable 2","deliverable 2 - team formation",url_type="anchor")} is how you communicate your team formation to me.

2. Keep practicing with <b>{expand_quiz(quizzes, "Practice Quiz 1","practice quiz 1", url_type="anchor", target="_blank")}</b> and when you're ready, take the <b>{expand_quiz(quizzes, "Quiz 1","Quiz 1 - Entity-relation models - Requires Respondus LockDown Browser + Webcam", url_type="anchor", target="_blank")} due this week.

3. Keep working on the other deliverables!  They are accepted LATE but don't get too far behind!
