We're very busy this week! Three deliverables - although it shouldn't take much time to complete them for full credit.
Be sure to take the [pre-class survey](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/105097/quizzes/199280" as soon as you can!
Then [introduce yourself](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/105097/assignments/966513) on the class discussion page and respond to other posts.
It's all about [finding a partner!](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/105097/quizzes/199284) for the [semester project](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/105097/pages/semester-project")

[A CMSC 408 Discord server](https://discord.gg/PfvpEMmwG9) for the class has been created. Here is [the invite](https://discord.gg/PfvpEMmwG9) When you join, you'll be granted limited access. To get full access, you'll need to change your name on the server to your preferred real name. Once I can match you up to the roster, I'll grant you full permissions.
