We’re very busy this week! Three deliverables - although it shouldn’t
take much time to complete them for full credit. Be sure to take the
\[pre-class
survey\](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/105097/quizzes/199280”
as soon as you can! Then [introduce
yourself](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/105097/assignments/966513)
on the class discussion page and respond to other posts. It’s all about
[finding a
partner!](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/105097/quizzes/199284)
for the [semester
project](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/105097/pages/semester-project%22)

[A CMSC 408 Discord server](https://discord.gg/PfvpEMmwG9) for the class
has been created. Here is [the invite](https://discord.gg/PfvpEMmwG9)
When you join, you’ll be granted limited access. To get full access,
you’ll need to change your name on the server to your preferred real
name. Once I can match you up to the roster, I’ll grant you full
permissions.
