Quiz title: Quiz 2 - Bank - ER Models - Blooms 2 (Understand)
Quiz description: This practice quiz focuses on entity-relation models and diagrams. 

    An entity-relationship (ER) model is a conceptual data model used in the field of database design to represent the structure of a database. It focuses on describing the entities (objects, concepts, or things) in a domain, the relationships between those entities, and the attributes (properties or characteristics) associated with the entities. The ER model is commonly used to visualize and understand the high-level organization of data within a system before it is implemented in a database management system.

    Bloom’s Taxonomy, revised in 2001, categorizes six levels of learning from lower- to higher-level thinking skills: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. Ideally, learning outcomes, class activities, and assessments map to these ascending levels throughout a class or course. Instructors can develop or select questions that assess different levels of cognition, keeping in mind that MC questions at the Create level may prove more challenging to develop.
