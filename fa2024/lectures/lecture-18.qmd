### Issue

* When I render my QMD file, I get an error.
* How do I track it down?

### Debugging strategies

* Open in VS code and run block-by-block
* Inspect variables to make sure that all is working as
expected.
* Insert new blocks as necessary.  Quarto and python don't care!
* It's like adding print statements.
