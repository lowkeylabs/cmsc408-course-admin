# Homework 6 - Constructing a database

## Homework 6 - Updates!

* I fixed a few issues in the main project repository.
    * If you haven't yet created your repository then you're OK. You'll get all the changes when you create your repo.
    * If you have created the project, then you need to merge my changes into your code:

```{bash}
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push
```

* In general this should work, depending on how many changes to your QMD file you've made.

* In some cases, you may get merge errors.

* If you do get errors then try to fix the merge on your own.
