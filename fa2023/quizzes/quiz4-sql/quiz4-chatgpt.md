Modify the quiz topics and coverage at the top. 
Modify the number of questions and blooms level at the bottom.

I suggest creating 25 questions in levels 2 and 3 and 15 questions in levels 4 and 5.
On the quiz, picking 10 in levels 2 and 3, and 5 in levels 4 and 5.

Blooms level 2 - Understand
Blooms level 3 - Apply
Blooms level 4 - Analyze
Blooms level 5 - Evaluate

- Create quiz
- Create homework assignment
- Create lectures

Hi chatgpt. I'd like you to play the role of a professor teaching an undergraduate course in database theory and design.
You are current teaching and learning module that focuses on introductory SQL. We've already covered ER diagrams, relational algebra and normalization.
Below is a specific list of topics that have been discussed:

* data definition language
* data manipulation language
* various SQL data types primarily with mysql dialect,
* SELECT using clauses FROM, WHERE and ORDER BY
* UPDATE using clauses FROM, WHERE and ORDER BY
* DELETE
* CREATE TABLE
* INSERT INTO
* DROP TABLE IF EXISTS
* accessing the database using PHPMYADMIN
* we've only lightly covered JOINS in the FROM clause.

Using the list of topics prepared above, you are to develop a multiple choice quiz assessing student knowledge of the material.
You are also very familiar with Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy, revised in 2001, which categorizes six levels of learning from lower- to higher-level thinking skills: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. Ideally, learning outcomes, class activities, and assessments like this multiple choice quiz will map to these ascending levels throughout a class or course. Instructors can develop or select assessment questions that assess different levels of cognition.

Below is an example of the format for each multiple choice question:

1. Which normal form requires that a relation is in 1NF and that it has no partial dependencies?
This question tests a students' knowledge of normal form criteria.
a) 2NF
... Incorrect.  2NF requires 1NF and something.
*b) 3NF
... CORRECT. 3NF requires a relation to be in 1NF and have no partial dependencies.
c) BCNF
... Incorrect.  BCNF requires 3NF and something.
d) 4NF
... Incorrect. This option doesn't accurately describe the requirements of 3NF.

As shown above, please state each question.
In a separate sentence following the question, starting the sentence with  "..." followed by a brief informal one sentence description of the concept being assessed by the question.
Then offer four possible responses each labeled with letters starting with lower case "a" followed by a ")".
The correct response should be labeled with a "*" as preceding the response label.
Directly under EACH individual response is a sentence marked "... CORRECT" or "... Incorrect", with a one sentence reason why the response is correct or incorrect.

Please provide a set of 25 multiple choice questions. All questions should be appropriate for and align with "Blooms level 5 - evaluate"
