Quiz title: Quiz1 - Bank - ER Models - Blooms 4 (Analyze)
Quiz description: This practice quiz focuses on entity-relation models and diagrams. 

    An entity-relationship (ER) model is a conceptual data model used in the field of database design to represent the structure of a database. It focuses on describing the entities (objects, concepts, or things) in a domain, the relationships between those entities, and the attributes (properties or characteristics) associated with the entities. The ER model is commonly used to visualize and understand the high-level organization of data within a system before it is implemented in a database management system.

    Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy, revised in 2001, categorizes six levels of learning from lower- to higher-level thinking skills: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. Ideally, learning outcomes, class activities, and assessments map to these ascending levels throughout a class or course. Instructors can develop or select questions that assess different levels of cognition, keeping in mind that MC questions at the Create level may prove more challenging to develop.



1. What issue arises if an ER diagram shows circular dependencies?
a) Data redundancy
b) Loss of data integrity
*c) Difficulty in mapping to a relational schema
d) Lower database security

2. You notice that there are redundant relationships between entities in an ER diagram. What is the likely impact?
a) It simplifies the diagram
*b) It creates confusion and ambiguity
c) It improves performance
d) It enhances data integrity

3. If two entities appear to have multiple relationships between them, what should you consider doing?
a) Eliminate one of the relationships
b) Make the entities inherit from a common parent
*c) Consolidate the relationships into a single, well-defined relationship
d) Separate the entities into distinct databases

4. When analyzing an ER diagram, what does the presence of many weak entities suggest?
a) The diagram is incomplete
b) The diagram is highly normalized
*c) The diagram may have excessive dependencies
d) The diagram is poorly designed

5. What is the main drawback of having too many ternary or higher-degree relationships?
a) Makes the ER diagram too simple
*b) May make the diagram difficult to understand and implement
c) Leads to a performance gain
d) Improves data integrity

6. When you see an entity with a high number of attributes, what might that suggest?
a) The entity is highly important
*b) The entity may need to be decomposed into smaller entities
c) The entity will improve database performance
d) The entity enhances security

7. If a relationship does not have a role label, what does it imply?
a) The relationship is incomplete
*b) The role is self-explanatory
c) The relationship is weak
d) The relationship is derived

8. If an attribute is frequently used in calculations, what type of attribute could it be considered as?
a) Composite attribute
b) Single-valued attribute
c) Multi-valued attribute
*d) Derived attribute

9. If you observe that every entity is related to every other entity, what might this suggest?
a) The diagram is highly optimized
*b) The diagram is overly complex and may require simplification
c) The diagram is incomplete
d) The diagram represents a real-world scenario perfectly

10. When the cardinality between two entities is unclear, what should you do?
a) Assume a One-to-One relationship
b) Assume a Many-to-Many relationship
*c) Consult with stakeholders for clarification
d) Eliminate the relationship altogether
