I'm crafting a multiple choice quiz for a database class. The quiz should test knowledge of database design and ER diagrams.

Bloom’s Taxonomy, revised in 2001, categorizes six levels of learning from lower- to higher-level thinking skills: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. Ideally, learning outcomes, class activities, and assessments map to these ascending levels throughout a class or course. Instructors can develop or select questions that assess different levels of cognition, keeping in mind that MC questions at the Create level may prove more challenging to develop.

Please prepare 40 multiple choice questions testing knowledge of ER diagrams aligned with Bloom's levels "understand", "apply" and "Analyze", and "Evaluate", 10 questions at each level. Please state each question, and then offer at least four possible answers, labeled starting at "a" followed by a ")". After the block of responses, please restate the correct response.

Certainly! Crafting multiple choice questions that align with Bloom's Taxonomy can help measure the depth of understanding and cognitive ability related to database design and ER diagrams. Below are 40 questions aligned to the "Understand," "Apply," "Analyze," and "Evaluate" levels of Bloom's Taxonomy.
