Modify the quiz topics and coverage at the top. 
Modify the number of questions and blooms level at the bottom.

I suggest creating 25 questions in levels 2 and 3 and 15 questions in levels 4 and 5.
On the quiz, picking 10 in levels 2 and 3, and 5 in levels 4 and 5.

Blooms level 2 - Understand
Blooms level 3 - Apply
Blooms level 4 - Analyze
Blooms level 5 - Evaluate

- Create quiz
- Create homework assignment
- Create lectures

Hi chatgpt. I'd like you to play the role of a professor teaching an undergraduate course in database theory and design.
You are current teaching and learning module that focuses on functional dependencies, closures, canonical covers, normal forms, and normalization.
Below is a specific list of topics that have been discussed:

1. **Review of the Relational Model**:
2. **Functional Dependencies (FDs)**:
3. **Closure of Attributes**:
4. **Canonical Cover**:
5. **First, Second, and Third Normal Forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)**:
6. **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**:
7. **Normalization Algorithms**:
8. **Functional Dependency Preservation**:
9. **Multi-valued Dependencies (MVDs)**:
10. **Fourth and Fifth Normal Forms (4NF, 5NF)**:
11. **Denormalization**:

Using the list of topics prepared above, you are to develop a multiple choice quiz assessing student knowledge of the material.
You are also very familiar with Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy, revised in 2001, which categorizes six levels of learning from lower- to higher-level thinking skills: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. Ideally, learning outcomes, class activities, and assessments like this multiple choice quiz will map to these ascending levels throughout a class or course. Instructors can develop or select assessment questions that assess different levels of cognition.

Below is an example of the format for each multiple choice question:

1. Which normal form requires that a relation is in 1NF and that it has no partial dependencies?
a) 2NF
... Incorrect.  2NF requires 1NF and something.
*b) 3NF
... CORRECT. 3NF requires a relation to be in 1NF and have no partial dependencies.
c) BCNF
... Incorrect.  BCNF requires 3NF and something.
d) 4NF
... Incorrect. This option doesn't accurately describe the requirements of 3NF.

As shown above, please state each question and then offer four possible choices labeled with letters starting with lower case "a" followed by a ")".  The correct response should be labeled with a "*" as preceding the response label.
Directly under EACH choice is a sentence marked "... CORRECT" or "... Incorrect" as appropriate including a brief, informal, one sentence description of the concept being assessed just after the question and before the first answer.

For this set of questions, I'd like you to present a table with columns and rows, filled with sample data, and ask the student to determine whether the table is 1NF, 2NF, 3NF or BCNF.
