"Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles;"

## Prompt

i'm brainstorming performance indicators for the student learning outcome:
"Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles;"
Please provide 3 performance indicators that align with the learning outcome.
For each performance indicator, I'd like two measurement criteria.  Each measure should be evaluated with a rubric that includes a ranged set of four evaluation criteria with the following categories: exceeds expectations, meets expectations, developing, and unsatisfactory. In the rubric, exceeds expectations should be on the left. I'd like the rubric laid out as a table with five columns, with the first column containing the criteria and the remaining four columns containing the evaluation categories. Please ensure that the description of each criteria fits within a single cell, and that each rubric has five columns in both the body and header.

## Response

Feel free to modify these rubrics according to your specific needs and institutional standards. The rubrics provided here are designed to help you evaluate students' performance in alignment with the stated learning outcomes.

## Prompt

I'm brainstorming performance indicators for the student learning outcome:
"Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles;"
The knowledge domain is database theory and design.
Please provide 3 performance indicators that align with the learning outcome.
I'd like to evaluate each performance indicator in four categories: exceeds expectations, meets expectations, developing, and unsatisfactory.
I'd like each performance indicator and evaluation catagories arranged in a horizontal table with performance indicator on the left and unsatisfactory on the right.
Care should be taken to ensure that each description fits within a single cell of the table and the table should only have three rows.

## Response

I apologize for the confusion. I understand now. Here's the corrected table without the "-" in the cell contents:

| Performance Indicator                                    | Exceeds Expectations                              | Meets Expectations                            | Developing                                    | Unsatisfactory                               |
|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **1. Ethical Decision-Making**                            | Consistently applies legal and ethical principles to complex scenarios, demonstrating deep understanding of implications in database theory and design. | Applies legal and ethical principles to various scenarios, showing understanding of implications in database theory and design. | Demonstrates some awareness of legal and ethical considerations, but struggles to apply them consistently in database-related contexts. | Lacks awareness of legal and ethical principles in various scenarios. |
| **2. Professional Responsibility**                        | Takes a proactive role in identifying potential legal and ethical issues in database projects, consistently integrating them into project planning. | Identifies potential legal and ethical considerations in database projects, considering their impact on project planning and execution. | Recognizes basic legal and ethical considerations, but may overlook critical aspects, potentially leading to oversights and risks. | Fails to recognize or address legal and ethical considerations. |
| **3. Ethical Dilemma Resolution**                         | Effectively navigates complex ethical dilemmas in database work, balancing technical requirements with legal and moral considerations for optimal outcomes. | Analyzes and addresses common ethical dilemmas in database work, making balanced decisions based on legal and moral considerations. | Recognizes straightforward ethical dilemmas but may struggle with more complex situations or defaults to technical aspects over ethical considerations. | Struggles to identify ethical dilemmas and lacks awareness of legal and moral considerations. |

I apologize for any confusion earlier. I hope this table format accurately presents the information you're looking for.
