Precious files
======

In general, I try to automate the gathering of materials for class review.

In some cases, like quizzes built into canvas, it is more difficult to automate that process.  Perhaps someday I'll write a puppeteer script to automate the printing of the quizzes and other materials.

Until then, this folder contains master copies of files that were manually generated. The main folder (above) can be cleaned, and when rebuilt pull the 
copies of these materials up.

This can help eliminate any issues of what can or cannot be deleted.

Anything in this folder CANNOT be deleted.
