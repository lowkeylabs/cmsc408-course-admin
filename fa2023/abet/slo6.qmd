"Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions;"

## Prompt

I'm brainstorming performance indicators for the student learning outcome:
"Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions;"
The knowledge domain is database theory and design.
Please provide 3 performance indicators that align with the learning outcome.
For each performance indicator, I'd like two measurement criteria.  Each measure should be evaluated with a rubric that includes a ranged set of four evaluation criteria with the following categories: exceeds expectations, meets expectations, developing, and unsatisfactory. In the rubric, exceeds expectations should be on the left. I'd like the rubric laid out as a table with five columns, with the first column containing the criteria and the remaining four columns containing the evaluation categories. Please ensure that the description of each criteria fits within a single cell, and that each rubric has five columns in both the body and header.
