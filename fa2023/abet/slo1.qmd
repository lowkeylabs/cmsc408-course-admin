"Analyze a complex computing problem and apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions."

## Prompt

I'm brainstorming performance indicators for the student learning outcome:
"Analyze a complex computing problem and apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions."
The knowledge domain is database theory and design.
Please provide 3 performance indicators that align with the learning outcome.
For each performance indicator, I'd like two measurement criteria.  Each measure should be evaluated with a rubric that includes a ranged set of four evaluation criteria with the following categories: exceeds expectations, meets expectations, developing, and unsatisfactory. In the rubric, exceeds expectations should be on the left. I'd like the rubric laid out as a table with five columns, with the first column containing the criteria and the remaining four columns containing the evaluation categories. Please ensure that the description of each criteria fits within a single cell, and that each rubric has five columns in both the body and header.

## Additional work after a conversation with Ahmed 8/30/2023

### prompt

I'm working with student learning outcomes and performance indicators. Given a student learning outcome, I am to create several performance indicators. Each performance indicators must satisfactorially answer these questions:
- Does the performance indicator support the intended outcome?
- Does the performance indicator describe what the students should know (cognitative), do (behaviorial) or think (affective)?
- Is the performance indicator specific, measureable, a result of learning?
- Can activities be designed to enable students to learn the desired performance indicator?
- Is the performance indicator a "leading indicator" for the outcome?
- Can results of assessment of student work against the performance indicator be used to make decisions on how to improve the program?

The student learning outcome is: "Analyze a complex computing problem and apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions." The knowledge domain is database theory and design.
Please provide 3 performance indicators that align with the learning outcome.
I'd like to evaluate each performance indicator in four categories: exceeds expectations, meets expectations, developing, and unsatisfactory.
I'd like each performance indicator and evaluation catagories arranged in a horizontal table with performance indicator on the left and unsatisfactory on the right.
Care should be taken to ensure that each description fits within a single cell of the table and the table should only have three rows. Each cell in the table should NOT use hyphens or dashes.

### result. ChatGPT 4.0 8/31/2023

Certainly! Below is a table that lists three performance indicators aligned with the given student learning outcome in the context of database theory and design. The table also includes four evaluation categories for each performance indicator.

| Performance Indicator | Exceeds Expectations | Meets Expectations | Developing | Unsatisfactory |
|-----------------------|----------------------|--------------------|------------|----------------|
| 1. Develop a query to extract relevant data for solving a computing problem. | Formulates a query that is not only correct but also optimized for performance. | Correctly formulates a query to extract the necessary data. | Formulates a query with minor errors or inefficiencies. | Unable to formulate a relevant query. |
| 2. Create a relational schema that addresses the requirements of a complex computing problem. | Designs a relational schema that is correct, normalized, and highly efficient. | Designs a correct and normalized relational schema. | Designs a schema with some redundancy or errors. | Fails to design a relevant schema. |
| 3. Evaluate and select appropriate database technologies to solve a given problem. | Evaluates multiple database technologies and justifies the best choice with relevant metrics. | Correctly selects an appropriate database technology for the problem. | Selects a database technology but with limited justification. | Fails to select or justify an appropriate database technology. |

To evaluate whether these performance indicators satisfy the criteria you've outlined:

1. **Does the performance indicator support the intended outcome?**  
   Yes, all three indicators aim to measure aspects of analyzing a complex computing problem in the domain of database theory and design.

2. **Does the performance indicator describe what the students should know (cognitive), do (behavioral), or think (affective)?**  
   All three indicators focus on what students should "do" (behavioral) and "know" (cognitive).

3. **Is the performance indicator specific, measurable, a result of learning?**  
   Yes, they are specific (e.g., "Develop a query," "Create a relational schema"), measurable (can be assessed through coursework or exams), and result from learning database theory and design.

4. **Can activities be designed to enable students to learn the desired performance indicator?**  
   Absolutely, activities like hands-on exercises, assignments, and projects can be designed to train students on these performance indicators.

5. **Is the performance indicator a "leading indicator" for the outcome?**  
   Yes, mastering these performance indicators would be strong leading indicators that the student can "analyze a complex computing problem and apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions."

6. **Can results of assessment of student work against the performance indicator be used to make decisions on how to improve the program?**  
   Definitely, the evaluation categories allow for a nuanced assessment of student proficiency, informing future curriculum adjustments.
