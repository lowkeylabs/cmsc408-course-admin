"Design, implement and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the discipline of computer science." 

## Prompt

i'm brainstorming performance indicators for the student learning outcome:
"Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts;"
The knowledge domain is database theory and design.
Please provide 3 performance indicators that align with the learning outcome.
For each performance indicator, I'd like one measure.  Each measure should include a ranged set of four criteria with the following categories: exceeds expectations, meets expectations, developing, and unsatisfactory. In the rubric, exceeds expections should be on the left. I'd like the rubric layed out as a table with five columns.

## Response
Certainly, I'd be happy to help you create performance indicators and a rubric for the student learning outcome "Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts" in the context of database theory and design. Here are three performance indicators along with their associated measures and rubrics:

---

**Performance Indicator 1: Written Documentation**
*Measure: Quality of written documentation created for a database design project.*

| Criteria               | Exceeds Expectations       | Meets Expectations      | Developing               | Unsatisfactory          |
|------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Clarity and Structure  | Clear and well-organized   | Generally clear         | Somewhat unclear         | Unclear and disorganized|
| Technical Language     | Consistently appropriate   | Mostly appropriate     | Occasionally unclear    | Often misuses language |
| Visual Aids            | Highly effective           | Generally effective    | Somewhat effective      | Ineffective or absent  |
| Cohesiveness           | Excellent integration      | Mostly integrated      | Partial integration     | Lacks integration      |

**Performance Indicator 2: Verbal Presentation**
*Measure: Quality of a verbal presentation explaining a complex database concept.*

| Criteria               | Exceeds Expectations       | Meets Expectations      | Developing               | Unsatisfactory          |
|------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Content Mastery        | Comprehensive knowledge    | Solid understanding    | Partial understanding   | Inaccurate information  |
| Engagement             | Highly engaging and dynamic| Mostly engaging        | Somewhat engaging       | Monotonous or unclear  |
| Clarity and Precision  | Highly clear and precise   | Generally clear         | Occasionally unclear    | Confusing and unclear  |
| Interaction            | Skillful interaction       | Adequate interaction   | Limited interaction     | Poor or no interaction |

**Performance Indicator 3: Collaborative Discussion**
*Measure: Effectiveness in participating in a group discussion on a database design problem.*

| Criteria               | Exceeds Expectations       | Meets Expectations      | Developing               | Unsatisfactory          |
|------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Active Contribution    | Consistently contributes   | Mostly contributes     | Occasionally contributes| Rarely contributes     |
| Problem Analysis       | Offers deep insights       | Provides insightful    | Offers limited insights | Lacks analysis         |
| Respectful Dialogue    | Always respectful          | Mostly respectful      | Occasionally disruptive | Disrespectful           |
| Synthesis of Ideas     | Skillfully synthesizes     | Adequately synthesizes | Partial synthesis       | Lacks synthesis        |

Feel free to adjust the criteria and language to better fit your specific context and requirements. This rubric should provide a clear framework for evaluating students' performance in effectively communicating about database theory and design in various professional contexts.
