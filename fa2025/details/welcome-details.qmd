<p class="lead">Welcome to CMSC 408 - Databases</p>

I'm glad you're here!

<p class="lead">General Overview of the Course</p>

This course introduces students to the fundamentals of databases and how they are used to solve real-world problems. Students will learn how to design databases, implement them in SQL, and work with data through queries and reports. Along the way, they will practice analyzing problems, creating data models, and translating those models into working database systems. By the end of the course, students will be able to build and use databases to organize information and support decision-making.
