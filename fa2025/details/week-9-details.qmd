#### Are we having fun yet?

As of Monday morning, 36 of 150 students have submitted Homework 5.  ARGHH! We'll talk more about it - and do some more walkthroughs in Class.

For the on-line people - WATCH LECTURE 15 (after it's posted, but you're welcome to watch live, too!) we'll be playing with Homework 5 and the tools you need to have running.

YES - homework 5 is challenging - BUT JUST DO IT!  The rest of the class will be MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE if you get the tools running, and you're able to working with some proficiency.  You're CS majors - you got this!
