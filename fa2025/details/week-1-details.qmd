#### And so we begin!

This will be a very busy semester!  This course will have homework assignments due almost every week.

Check out the [Welcome page](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/122236/pages/welcome-front-page) for more details on the course.

Base on feedback from past student evaluations, I am dropping the semester-long project.  Grades for the 
course will depend on homeworks, quizzes, and participation in online discussions.  See [Canvas Syllabus](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/122236/assignments/syllabus) for all the gory details.

Each week I update this *frontpage* with a fresh list of *things to do* and additional *notes on resources*.  Be 
sure to regularly visit this Canvas to keep on track.  This page also contains links to the lecture slides and video of the lecture.

**ON-LINE STUDENTS** I *highly* suggest
that you review the slides AND watch the lecture.  I provide lots of *undocumented* details in the lecture,
guaranteed to *[Save you Hours](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/122236/pages/resource-save-you-hours)*.

Finally - the lecture slides will be changed and edited up until the lecture itself.  SO - if you do choose to look
ahead, remember that future lectures can change.

#### Things to do this week

#### Notes on the Resources

Review ALL the resources above. Here are some additional notes:
    
[Course Discord](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/122236/pages/resource-course-discord) - The course has a discord server!  Follow this link to find the invite.


[Databases on real hardware (video and notes)](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/122236/pages/resource-week-1-databases-on-real-hardware-video-and-notes) I REALLY love mainframes!  These beasts drive the world, yet they are shunned. This cool video introduces you to a Z16 - VCU owns one!


[ACID explained](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/122236/pages/resource-week-1-acid-explained) What makes databases different than spreadsheets?While they share many common attributes - and one can use a spreadsheet like a database - there is one HUGE difference ... ACID!


[SAVE YOU HOURSâ„¢](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/122236/pages/resource-save-you-hours) - It's really easy to get lost in this course.  There is TONS of stuff coming at you very fast.  Check out this page to get a list of suggestions to help keep you on track.
