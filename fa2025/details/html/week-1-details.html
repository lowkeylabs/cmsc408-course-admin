<h4 id="and-so-we-begin">And so we begin!</h4>
<p>This will be a very busy semester! This course will have homework assignments due almost every week.</p>
<p>Check out the Welcome page for more details on the course.</p>
<p>Base on feedback from past student evaluations, I am dropping the semester-long project. Grades for the course will depend on homeworks, quizzes, and participation in online discussions.</p>
<p>Each week I update this <em>frontpage</em> with a fresh list of <em>things to do</em> and additional <em>notes on resources</em>. Be sure to regularly visit this Canvas to keep on track.</p>
<p>This page also contains links to the lecture slides and video of the lecture. <strong>ON-LINE STUDENTS</strong> I <em>highly</em> suggest that you review the slides AND watch the lecture. I provide lots of <em>undocumented</em> details in the lecture, guaranteed to <em>Save you time</em>.</p>
<p>Finally - the lecture slides will be changed and edited up until the lecture itself. SO - if you do choose to look ahead, remember that future lectures can change.</p>
