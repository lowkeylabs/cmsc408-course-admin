<p class="lead">Week 5 - more on relational algebra</p>

The relational model gives a way to store data - tables, rows, keys, and all that.  So - what do we do with all that stuff?  

Relational algebra gives the tools to describe on paper and implement in the computer operations that manipulate our relations, that is, our tables and rows.

## Note that other html attributes (e.g., width=, height=, etc.) can be added
## This will return a canvas-ready <img /> tag .
