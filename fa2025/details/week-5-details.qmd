<p class="lead">This week is shortened for the [CAREER FAIR!](https://egr.vcu.edu/current-students/career-services/students/career-fair/)</p>

Be sure that you drop into the [Internship and Career Fair](https://egr.vcu.edu/current-students/career-services/students/career-fair/) this Wednesday, Feb. 12, if you set some up good luck with your interviews on Thursday, Interview Day!

**There will be no class on Thursday, February 13.**

#### Things to do this week!

[Quiz 2 on relational algebra ](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/113813/quizzes/211166) is due Thursday evening, Feb. 13th.  This quiz requires the lockdown browser, and will run just like the previous quizzes.

A [Practice Quiz 2](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/113813/quizzes/211171) is available.  You can take the practice
quiz as many times as you like.

[Homework 3 - Modeling your World](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/113813/assignments/1085011) is available for scaffolding
and is due Sunday, February 16.  This assignment is very much like the others - you're to create Chen and Crows Foot diagrams.  What's different?
You're be drafting the little write-ups, too!  This gives you good practice looking around your world and distilling what you see into a
brief, terse database description.

In the lecture this week we'll be covering more on Relational Algebra, specifically on joins.  This is one of the harder concepts
of relational algebra, relational modeling, and databases.  Once you get the concept - you'll own databases.

## Note that other html attributes (e.g., width=, height=, etc.) can be added
## This will return a canvas-ready <img /> tag .
