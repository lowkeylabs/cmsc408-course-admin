#### Notes on the Resources

Review ALL the resources above. Here are some additional notes:
    
[Database design](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/122236/pages/resource-database-design) A curated set of videos describing database design and offering examples to help get you started.  ER modeling is only one step of the larger process.


[ER Modeling](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/122236/pages/resource-er-modeling) A curated set of videos providing greater detail on difference aspects of ER modeling, including entities, attributes, relationships, cardinality and participation.


[Quarto Overview](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/122236/pages/resource-week-2-quarto-overview) You'll be spending LOTS of time this semester using Quarto.  It's important that you get a feel for how this important data science tool works.


[WSL Tools](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/122236/pages/resource-wsl-tools) Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a great tool to learn.  You get all the features of a linux system, without having to give up all the Windows tools, utilities, and of course ... games!


[GIT Tools](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/122236/pages/resource-git-tools) Learning GIT and GITHUB is really, really important to your success in this class.  I assembled these videos to help you get started.


[Practice Quiz 1](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/122236/assignments/1241146) You can take the practice quiz as many times as you like.  The real quiz will be exactly the same, except you'll need the lockdown browser.
