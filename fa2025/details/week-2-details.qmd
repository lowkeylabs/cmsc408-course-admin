<p class="lead">How do you craft a database? How do you represent the real world in a database?</p>

The lectures this week will focus on designing databases and on the basics of entity-relationship modeling.  We'll be doing lots of
examples to get practice.


### Things to do this week

```{python}
print(f"""
1. <b>{expand_assignment(assignments,"Deliverable 1 - Intros","Deliverable 1 - Intros",url_type="anchor")}</b> - If you haven't already, complete project deliverable 1.  In this
assignment you're introducint yourself  Harmonize and meeting others in the class. One goal is to find a partner for the semester-long project.
2. <b>{expand_assignment(assignments,"Deliverable 2 - Team formation","deliverable 2 - team formation",url_type="anchor")}</b> - Once you find a partner, complete
this on-line survey to tell me about your team.
3. <b>{expand_quiz(quizzes, "Practice Quiz 1","practice quiz 1", url_type="anchor", target="_blank")}</b> - Start Practice Quiz 1. You can
take this quiz as many times as you like.  The *real* quiz is scheduled for next week, Week 3.  If you're comfy, you can take it as soon as it opens, no need to wait.
4. <b>{expand_assignment(assignments,"Homework 1 - Data Engineering Tool Review","Homework 1 - DE Tool Review",url_type="anchor")}</b> - this is homework assignment is due Sunday.  
Don't wait to the last minute. There is lots to do and tools to install.
5. <b>{expand_assignment(assignments,"Discussion 1 - ER Modeling","Discussion 1 - ER modeling",url_type="anchor")}</b> - *Practice, practice, practice*.  This Harmonize discussion allows
