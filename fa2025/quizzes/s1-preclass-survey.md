Quiz title: Pre-class survey
Quiz description: This is a simple survey to help me learn more about you. This activity is what is called a "graded survey", that is, you submit it and get points for submitting ANYTHING! Your individual responses don't have a right or wrong answers  (Translated - successful completion of this survey means an easy 5 points!)

    I plan to share AGGREGATE SURVEY RESULTS with the class.  No details about individuals, simply aggregate responses. Any fill-in-the-blank responses will not be shared, either. I think you'll find some of the questions and answers fun.

    This survey also serves a second purpose. It assures both you and me that you've got everything set up for the the Respondus Lockdown browser.  Quizzes in this class will be administered on-line using Canvas and the lockdown browser. Rather than blowing things up during the first real quiz, we'll use this opportunity to dip our toes in the water and get everything working properly early.

    BEFORE YOU START - make sure that you've got your GITHUB USERID. If you don't have a GITHUB account, create one!  Otherwise, be sure that you've got your user id handy.

    NO STRESS - I want to know more about you AND give you a chance to work the bugs out of any techno-problems BEFORE it really matters.
