## ER Diagramming Walkthrough
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Problem 

Design a gradebook database for this class.

- What do you want to track? Why?

- If you used a spreadsheet, what would it look like?  

- What are entities, attributes and relationships?

- What about cardinality and participation?

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Let's do it


Open a quarto window, create a document in VS code and start diagramming!


I'll walkthrough this example in real-time, discussing design
considerations, tradeoffs, and finally arriving at something we can code.

Start with potential entities?  Attributes?

Then add relationships, cardinality and participation.

Then try drawing it.
