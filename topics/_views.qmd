# VIEWS in SQL

## VIEWS in SQL

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
### What is a VIEW?
- A View is a virtual table in SQL.
- It does not store data itself but retrieves data from one or more underlying tables.

### Why Use VIEWS?
- Simplify complex queries.
- Provide an abstraction layer for security.
- Hide the complexity of underlying database schema.
- Very useful with API development

## VIEWS in SQL: Benefits and Considerations

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
### Other DDL commands
- CREATE VIEW
- DROP VIEW
- CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW

### Benefits of Views
- Data abstraction and security.
- Reusability of complex queries.
- Performance optimization by precomputing results.

::: {.column}
### Considerations
- Views can hide underlying schema complexity, but overuse can lead to confusion.
- Views may impact query performance if they involve complex operations or large datasets.
- Views are NOT tables, they are reevaluated every time they're called.
- Views are NOT a substitute for a well-structured WITH query.
- WARNING - changes in underlying tables can affect view results.

## VIEWS - Creating a VIEW

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
### Syntax
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
* CREATE VIEW is a DDL statement
* VIEWS should be defined in same DDL file that creates your database
* VIEWS should be designed with API to simplify API queries.

::: {.column}
### Example
```sql
CREATE VIEW customer_orders AS
  SELECT 
    customers.customer_name, orders.order_date
  FROM
    customers
    JOIN orders ON 
    customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```
