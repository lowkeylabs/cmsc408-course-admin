## Importance of Keys in Database Design

Keys are essential in database design as they ensure the uniqueness of records and help establish relationships between tables. Understanding different types of keys is fundamental for maintaining data integrity.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- Keys are attributes or sets of attributes that uniquely identify a record in a table.
- Without keys, there would be no way to distinguish between two identical records.
- Keys play a crucial role in indexing, which speeds up query performance.
- They help maintain data integrity by enforcing uniqueness.
- Proper use of keys prevents data duplication and ensures accurate retrieval.

## Primary Keys: The Foundation of Uniqueness

A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It is crucial for ensuring that no two records can have the same primary key value.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table.
- No two rows in a table can have the same primary key value.
- Primary keys cannot contain NULL values.
- They are automatically indexed to improve query performance.
- In relational databases, primary keys are the basis for establishing relationships between tables.

## Candidate Keys: Potential Primary Keys

Candidate keys are those that could potentially serve as a primary key. Understanding candidate keys is important for choosing the most appropriate primary key.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- A candidate key is any column or combination of columns that can uniquely identify a row in a table.
- Every table can have multiple candidate keys.
- Out of all candidate keys, one is chosen as the primary key.
- Candidate keys must be unique and not contain NULL values.
- They serve as alternative unique identifiers for records.

*Candidate keys offer flexibility in choosing the most suitable primary key for a table.*


## Composite Keys: Combining Multiple Attributes

Composite keys are formed by combining two or more attributes to create a unique identifier. They are useful when a single attribute is not sufficient to identify a record.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- A composite key is a primary key composed of two or more columns.
- It is used when no single attribute can uniquely identify a record.
- All columns in the composite key together must be unique.
- Composite keys are often used in junction tables to link two or more tables.
- They enforce multi-attribute uniqueness in relational databases.

*Composite keys are essential for uniquely identifying records in complex tables.*




## Surrogate Keys: A Unique System-Generated Identifier

Surrogate keys are artificial keys that are not derived from application data. They are commonly used when no natural primary key exists.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- A surrogate key is an artificially generated identifier used as the primary key.
- Surrogate keys are typically numeric and auto-incremented by the database system.
- They are not derived from business data, ensuring their immutability.
- Surrogate keys simplify indexing and improve performance in large databases.
- They are particularly useful in scenarios where natural keys are too complex or change frequently.

*Surrogate keys provide a simple and efficient way to uniquely identify records in a database.*




## Natural Keys: Using Business Data for Identification

Natural keys are keys that are derived from business data, such as a social security number or email address. They have real-world meaning but may have drawbacks in certain scenarios.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- A natural key is an attribute that has a real-world meaning and is used as a primary key.
- Examples include social security numbers, email addresses, or product codes.
- Natural keys can simplify data understanding for end users.
- They are prone to change, which can complicate database design and maintenance.
- Using natural keys can introduce dependencies on external data sources.

*Natural keys provide meaningful identifiers but can introduce complexity and dependencies.*




## Choosing Between Surrogate and Natural Keys

Deciding between surrogate and natural keys is a critical design choice that can affect the performance and maintainability of a database.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- Surrogate keys offer simplicity, especially in complex or large-scale databases.
- Natural keys provide meaningful identifiers but may require careful handling of changes.
- The choice depends on factors like data stability, performance needs, and system complexity.
- Surrogate keys are preferred when natural keys are prone to change or have a large data size.
- Consider using natural keys when the key has inherent business significance and low volatility.

*The choice between surrogate and natural keys should be guided by data characteristics and system requirements.*




## Ensuring Uniqueness: Constraints and Indexes

Uniqueness constraints and indexes are critical for enforcing the uniqueness of keys and improving the performance of queries.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- Uniqueness constraints ensure that key values are not duplicated across records.
- Primary keys automatically enforce uniqueness and create an index.
- Unique constraints can be applied to any column, not just the primary key.
- Indexes improve query performance by speeding up data retrieval.
- Proper indexing strategies are essential for maintaining fast and efficient databases.

## Keys in Relationships: Establishing Links Between Tables

Keys are essential for establishing relationships between tables in a relational database. Understanding foreign keys is key to effective database normalization.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- Foreign keys are columns that establish a link between two tables.
- A foreign key in one table points to the primary key in another table.
- Foreign keys enforce referential integrity, ensuring consistent relationships.
- Proper use of foreign keys prevents orphaned records and maintains data integrity.
- Relationships between tables are fundamental to database normalization and data integrity.

## Summary of Keys and Identifiers

Keys and identifiers are the backbone of relational databases, ensuring the uniqueness and integrity of data. Understanding the different types of keys and their applications is essential for effective database design.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- Keys uniquely identify records and prevent duplication.
- Primary keys, candidate keys, and composite keys serve different roles in database design.
- Surrogate keys simplify indexing and are used when natural keys are inadequate.
- Natural keys carry real-world meaning but may introduce complexities.
- Choosing the right key type is critical for ensuring data integrity and database performance.
