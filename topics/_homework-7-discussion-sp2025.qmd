## Homework 7 - discussion

Are you having issues with homework 7?

Try commenting out this block of code.

```{.python}
if not errors:
    messages,errors = execute_ddl_from_file( ddl_file_name, cnx)
```

Run your DDL file manually from VSCode, and then rebuild your QMD.

## Homework 7 - Issue #1

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=60%}

### Issue #1

This issue involves the connection *cnx*.  

Changes loaded by the DDL file are not fully available until
the connection is closed and reopenned.

### Two solutions

1. manually load DDL file and NOT load it in QMD.

1. force connection reset using *dispose* method.

::: {.column width=40%}
### Issue #2

* The database engine we're using (*innodb*) does not 
accurately store record counts in the *information_schema* table. 

* See [this link](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-infoschema-excerpt/8.0/en/information-schema-tables-table.html){target="_blank"} for more details.

* Ignore the counts, or

* Use `count(*)` to return accurate count.
