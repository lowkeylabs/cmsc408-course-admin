<!-- # Homework 6 - Walkthrough SP2025 -->

## Homework 6 - Updates!

* I fixed a few issues in the main project repository.
    * If you haven't yet created your repository then you're OK. You'll get all the changes when you create your repo.
    * If you have created the project, then you need to merge my changes into your code:

```{bash}
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push
```

* In general this should work, depending on how many changes to your QMD file you've made.

* In some cases, you may get merge errors.

* If you do get errors then try to fix the merge on your own.

## Homework 6 - Build your database incrementally!

* You *don't need* primary keys, foreign keys or unique field constraints.

* Primary, foreign keys, and UNIQUE are *integrity constraints*.

* They are all OPTIONAL and can added later.

* You can do "joins" without primary and foreign key, just use caution.

* Tables and records connect on values in the table.

* Primary keys, foreign keys and UNIQUE are your friends, don't ignore them.  With them, you can trust your database.

## Homework 6 - the DDL file

### Starter commands

* commands to create the database
* DROP TABLE, CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO

### Data constraints

* attributes to ensure that only good data gets into the database
* Data types: INT, DATE, VARCHAR(255), VARCHAR(4096)
* Data attributes:  NOT NULL, DEFAULT 

## Homework 6 - Integrity constraints

### Letting the DBMS run your DB!

* attributes to ensure that everything remains related properly
* PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY: wiring between tables
* UNIQUE: integrity across records

### Integrity constraints: Potential issues

QUESTION: what happens when a record mentioned in a foreign key is deleted?

EXAMPLE: what happens when we delete a SKILL and the skill is referenced in PEOPLESKILLS?

New statements:

* FOREIGN KEY ... **ON UPDATE**  ... **ON DELETE**

## Integrity constraints - [Foreign Keys](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-foreign-key/)

MySQL has five reference options: CASCADE, SET NULL, NO ACTION, RESTRICT, and SET DEFAULT.

CASCADE
: if a row from the parent table is deleted or updated, the values of the matching rows in the child table are automatically deleted or updated.

SET NULL
: if a row from the parent table is deleted or updated, the values of the foreign key column (or columns) in the child table are set to NULL.

RESTRICT
: if a row from the parent table has a matching row in the child table, MySQL rejects deleting or updating rows in the parent table.

NO ACTION
: is the same as RESTRICT.

SET DEFAULT
: is recognized by the MySQL parser. However, this action is rejected by both InnoDB and NDB tables.

## Homework 6 - By example

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=60%}
