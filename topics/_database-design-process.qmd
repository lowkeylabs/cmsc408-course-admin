### Database design process

1. Understanding requirements

2. Conceptual design

3. Logical design

4. Physical design

5. Implementation

### Notes

- The basic steps are listed on the left.
- There are many different approaches, some more complicated than others.
- Watch the videos, you'll see different approaches, but also see what's similar.
- Don't overthink it.
- Iterate and spiralize the process.  Don't expect perfection.

These steps map nicely with the [Semester Project](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/105097/pages/resource-week-2-semester-project?module_item_id=3767574) deliverables!  *Deliverable 8* represents the first three steps of the design.

## Database design process - some details

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

1. Understanding requirements
    * Problem domain,
    * Need,
    * Context, scope and perspective,
    * Uses cases, user roles
    * Security, privacy
    * Use cases, specific queries
2. Conceptual design
    * Entities, attributes, relationships
    * ER diagrams
3. Logical design
    * converting entities, attributes and relations, and other odd features to tables. 
    * Normalization and functional analysis

:::
::: {.column}
4. Physical design
    * Explicitly defining tables
    * Adding integrity constraints, triggers
    * Reporting: adding views
    * Maintenance: adding procedures
    * Considering access: defining an API layer
5. Implementation and iteration
    * code it up,
    * load it up, 
    * test it up,
    * see where you screwed it up,
    * iterate it up.

## Database design process - sharing your design

Understanding requirements
: We'll be using *quarto* to describe in words the various attributes.  We'll get practice
creating requirements.  These can get more complicated as one iterates.

Conceptual design
: We'll be using [Chen diagrams ](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320434.320440) to document our conceptual design.  In Quarto we'll be using *graphviz* to describe and render these diagrams.

Logical design
: We'll be using [Crows-foot diagrams] to document our logical design. In Quarto we'll be using *mermaid* to describe and render these diagrams.

Physical design
: We'll be using SQL to document our physical design.
