## Do I need really need a text book?
No, you don't. These textbooks are *really good* and package lots of information into a single place.

*Life is a database* and from my perspective it's all about speed of retrieval. When I'm building databases, I can't EVER recall pulling out a text book to look something up!

## CMSC 408 - Statement on Generative AI

* Grades for the course are assigned based on YOUR work, not the work of chatgpt, bard or some other generative AI tool. Grades help YOU understand where you are on the journey towards mastery of any pile of material.

* Generative AI can be a real asset in computing. You don’t need to memorize syntax, or struggle to hunt around to find some arcane code necessary to make your program work. But remember, it is supposed to be YOUR program.

* Homework assignments are designed to give you practice using the tools to create programs. The focus of the homework assignments is on the higher level cognitive skills - designing, comparing, judging, analyzing, assessing. **Use of Generative AI IS permitted on homework assignments and the semester project**, in so much as it can help the coding go faster. YOU are responsible for the design and should be able to explain it to anyone that asks.

* Quizzes are designed to test your knowledge of the course material. **Use of Generative AI is NOT permitted on any of the quizzes.**

* See [this document](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/113813/files?preview=14026400) to learn more!

### What you should expect ...

This is a programming class. Be prepared for TONS of coding.

We'll be learning and improving through practice and repitition. There will be LOTS of opportunity to practice.

We'll be learning to *code* documentation and graphics using Quarto with markdown, mermaid and graphviz.

We'll be learning how to communicate designs using ER diagrams and crows-feet diagrams.

We'll be learning to create, retrieve, update and delete database objects using SQL.

We'll be learning docker to containerize a database and application and automate the reptition.

## Advice from your peers

&nbsp;

### From course evaluation responses, Fall 2023:

::: {style="font-size: 125%; margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%; margin-top: 5%"}

*Discuss the level of difficulty of this course, the pace of the course, and the level of effort required to complete the work in this course.*

:::

## Advice from your peers

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
*This course is easy if you keep up with the work. Having assignments due every week along with the semester-long project is a lot to take on.*

&nbsp;

*I think there is a lot of work involved with this course, but so long as you stay on top of the assignments, you will be sucessful, as they are not really difficult, more so there is just a large quantity of them.*

&nbsp;

*The course was definitely difficult if not well prepared but the professor gives every single tool one needs to succeed. The pace was perfect and there is nothing I would change about it.*
::: 
::: {.column}
*The pace was quick and the work was not easy. Each week the homework presented new concepts that were progressively more difficult, and it was very easy to fall behind. Not the class with the sort of work you can leave till the last minute, minimum, a couple hours per assignment.*

&nbsp;

*Lot of the material that was covered in this class was all very new to me, but Professor Leonard designed the course in a way that wasn't too overwhelming. I felt like the pace of the course was just right. Even the times I was falling behind a little bit, I was able to pick myself back up pretty quickly since the deadlines weren't super strict. *

:::
::::

## Advice from your peers

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
*I found the course difficulty to be well balanced. If a student goes to class, asks questions, and makes an effort to do their assignment they should have no problem at all passing. The pace of the course was perfect and allowed enough time for each unit to be processed before moving on to the next one. *

&nbsp;

*The workload for this course is very challenging to manage. Having to create a whole database and then do weekly homework assignments is very difficult.*

&nbsp;

*This course required an intense amount of coding. However, given the clear expectations and due dates,  I was able to plan ahead to meet deadlines. *
::: 
::: {.column}
*This course is pretty easy, but I don't think it needs to be harder. It takes not much effort but still I feel like I am very good with databases, api's, even better at using python. I am still not good at writing queries though.*

&nbsp;

*There is a large level of effort required to this course. Especially towards the end of the semester the assignments and projects can be time consuming. That being said the professor gives more than enough time to complete them and he is very helpful if a section ends up being confusing for the class.*

&nbsp;

*This course was fairly difficult, but the professor made it very doable. The course pace was good, except by the end of the semester the pace gets really fast. 10/10 professor*
