<!-- expand this section with example questions and their solution with relational algebra -->



## Use Cases: Inner Join


Inner join is commonly used in scenarios where you only need matching data from two relations. It's ideal for combining related data.


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=98%}
- Frequently used when matching foreign keys with primary keys.
- Example: retrieving student records with matching course registrations.
- Ideal for filtering data to include only relevant, connected records.
- Used when non-matching data is not important for the query.
- Popular in most applications like finance, HR, and inventory systems.

*Inner join is ideal when you only care about related records from two relations.*



## Use Cases: Left and Right Outer Joins


Outer joins are useful when you want to keep all records from one side, even if they don't have a match in the other relation.


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=98%}
- Left outer join is often used in master-detail relationships.
- Example: retrieving all customers and their orders, including customers without orders.
- Right outer join can be used when focusing on all records from a detail table.
- Used when incomplete data is acceptable, such as optional relationships.
- Often used in customer management systems to track unfilled orders.

## Use Cases: Full Outer Join


Full outer join is used in scenarios where you need to retain all data, even if some entries don't match. This join is comprehensive.


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=98%}
- Often used in data integration tasks.
- Example: merging two datasets where both may contain unmatched records.
- Used in scenarios like combining employee records from different departments.
- Useful in data warehousing and analytics to ensure no data is lost.
- Common in reconciling data from different sources with partial overlap.

## Combining Joins for Complex Queries


Different join types can be combined to solve complex queries involving multiple relations. This is often used in real-world database systems.


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=98%}
- Inner and outer joins can be combined in complex queries.
- Example: joining multiple relations with inner joins, then an outer join to fill gaps.
- Different join types solve different parts of the same query.
- Used in multi-table queries for comprehensive data retrieval.
- Often seen in reporting systems that need complete data coverage.
