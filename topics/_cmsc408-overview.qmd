### Homework Assignments

::: {style="font-size:0.9em;"}
Homework assignments are done individually. Homeworks will be distributed using GITHUB classroom; a link will be provided in the Canvas assignment page. Homeworks will be
submitted to Gradescope. Each assignment is worth 20 points. Rubrics will be
provided. Homeworks will be written using Quarto. Homework 2 provides an opportunity
to learn more about Quarto. Quarto will also be used for the semester project.

### Quizzes

::: {style="font-size:0.9em;"}
There will be four quizzes throughout the semester. Each quiz will be worth 30 points.
Quizzes will be administered on-line usint the Respondus lockdown browser. It is
the responsibility of the student to ensure that the technology works. Homework assignment 1 offers practice to work out the bugs. Quizzes will be administered during class time.

### Semester-long project

::: {style="font-size:0.9em;"}
Students will work in teams of 2 on a semester-long project. The project will
require the students design and build a database backend presenting an API. The
domain of the project is chosen by the students. Tools include SQL, python, flask, MySQL, Quarto, and others.

## Do I need really need a text book?
No, you don't. These textbooks are *really good* and package lots of information into a single place.

*Life is a database* and from my perspective it's all about speed of retrieval. When I'm building databases, I can't EVER recall pulling out a text book to look something up!
:::

## Canvas as the OFFICIAL platform

YOU are responsible for your own LEARNING. My role is GUIDE and CURATOR.

WE are working together as a TEAM so that at completion of the course, you are comfortable with designing and building databases.

ANYTHING posted to the course canvas is FAIR GAME to be tested. If I think it's important enough to be shared as part of the course materials on Canvas, I believe that it's important enough for you to be familiar with it and possibly tested on it.

I will OFTEN not be able to cover all the material relevant to a specific topic in class. That does NOT mean that it isn't important. Even if I don’t complete the lecture slides during a class session, you should be familiar with ALL the material in the slides. ANYTHING in the lecture slides is FAIR GAME for testing.

## Statement on Generative AI

Grades for the course are assigned based on YOUR work, not the work of chatgpt, bard or some other generative AI tool. Grades help YOU understand where you are on the journey towards mastery of any pile of material.

Generative AI can be a real asset in computing. You don’t need to memorize syntax, or struggle to hunt around to find some arcane code necessary to make your program work. But remember, it is supposed to be YOUR program.

Homework assignments are designed to give you practice using the tools to create programs. The focus of the homework assignments is on the higher level cognitive skills - designing, comparing, judging, analyzing, assessing. **Use of Generative AI IS permitted on homework assignments and the semester project**, in so much as it can help the coding go faster. YOU are responsible for the design and should be able to explain it to anyone that asks.

Quizzes are designed to test your knowledge of the course material. **Use of Generative AI is NOT permitted on any of the quizzes.**
