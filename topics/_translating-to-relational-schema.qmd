# Translating to Relational Schema



## Converting ER Diagrams to Relational Schemas

Translating ER diagrams into relational schemas is a fundamental step in database design. This process involves converting entities, relationships, and attributes into tables, columns, and constraints.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- Entities in the ER diagram typically become tables in the relational schema.
- Each attribute of an entity maps to a column in the corresponding table.
- Relationships between entities often become foreign keys in the relational schema.
- For many-to-many relationships, an associative entity or junction table is created.
- Primary keys from the ER model are carried over as primary keys in the relational schema.
- Composite attributes are typically flattened into individual columns in the table.

## Mapping Entities to Tables

Mapping entities to tables involves creating a table for each entity in the ER model. Each table consists of columns that represent the attributes of the entity.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- Each entity in the ER model becomes a table in the relational schema.
- The table's columns correspond to the entity's attributes.
- The primary key of the entity becomes the primary key of the table.
- Composite attributes are divided into separate columns.
- Derived attributes are not typically included as columns in the table.
- Multivalued attributes require special handling, often involving separate tables.

*Mapping entities to tables is the first step in creating a relational schema from an ER model.*

## Mapping Relationships to Foreign Keys

Relationships in the ER model are implemented using foreign keys in the relational schema. Foreign keys enforce referential integrity between related tables.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- One-to-one relationships may result in a foreign key in either of the related tables.
- One-to-many relationships are implemented with a foreign key in the "many" side table.
- Many-to-many relationships are implemented with a junction table that includes foreign keys from both related tables.
- Foreign keys maintain the referential integrity between tables.
- Constraints such as ON DELETE CASCADE can be used to manage related records.
- Proper indexing of foreign keys improves query performance.

*Foreign keys are crucial for maintaining the relationships defined in the ER model.*


## Handling Composite Attributes

Composite attributes need to be flattened into individual columns in the relational schema. This ensures that each column stores a single, atomic value.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- Composite attributes are attributes that can be divided into smaller subparts.
- Each subpart of a composite attribute is represented as a separate column.
- For example, a "Full Name" attribute might be split into "First Name" and "Last Name."
- The original composite attribute does not appear as a separate column in the table.
- Flattening ensures compliance with the principles of normalization.
- This process helps avoid redundancy and improves data consistency.

*Flattening composite attributes is essential for adhering to relational database design principles.*


## Dealing with Multivalued Attributes

Multivalued attributes, which can have multiple values for a single entity, are handled by creating separate tables. This ensures that each value is stored in its own record.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- Multivalued attributes allow an entity to have multiple values for a single attribute.
- In the relational schema, multivalued attributes require a separate table.
- The separate table typically includes a foreign key referencing the original entity's table.
- Each record in the new table represents one value of the multivalued attribute.
- This approach avoids repeating groups and maintains data normalization.
- Example: A "Phone Numbers" attribute might become a separate table linked to the "Person" table.
:::
::: {.column width=5%}

:::

*Handling multivalued attributes with separate tables ensures the schema remains normalized and manageable.*




## Mapping Weak Entities

Weak entities, which depend on other entities for their existence, require special handling in relational schemas. They are typically implemented using a combination of primary and foreign keys.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- Weak entities lack a primary key of their own and rely on a "strong" entity for identification.
- In the relational schema, weak entities are represented by tables that include a foreign key from the strong entity.
- The primary key of the weak entityâ€™s table is often a composite key including the foreign key.
- This approach ensures that each instance of the weak entity is uniquely identifiable.
- Relationships between weak and strong entities must be carefully mapped to maintain integrity.
- Example: A "Dependent" table might include a foreign key to the "Employee" table, along with a partial key like "Dependent ID."

*Mapping weak entities requires careful consideration to ensure they are correctly represented in the relational schema.*


## Handling Many-to-Many Relationships

Many-to-many relationships in the ER model are converted into relational schemas by creating a junction table. This table holds foreign keys from both participating entities.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- Many-to-many relationships involve multiple instances of two entities relating to each other.
- A junction table is used to represent the many-to-many relationship in the relational schema.
- The junction table includes foreign keys from both related tables.
- The primary key of the junction table is typically a composite key made up of the two foreign keys.
- Additional attributes of the relationship can also be stored in the junction table.
- This approach ensures that the many-to-many relationship is correctly implemented without redundancy.

*Junction tables are essential for accurately representing many-to-many relationships in a relational schema.*




## Mapping Generalization and Specialization

Generalization and specialization in ER models are mapped to relational schemas using either a single table or multiple tables, depending on the approach.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- Generalization involves combining multiple entities into a single, generalized entity.
- Specialization involves breaking down a generalized entity into more specific entities.
- A single-table approach involves creating one table with columns for all attributes, including a type discriminator.
- A multi-table approach involves creating separate tables for each specialized entity, with a shared primary key from the generalized entity.
- The choice between these approaches depends on factors like redundancy and performance.
- Proper handling ensures that inheritance is correctly represented in the relational schema.

*Choosing the right approach for mapping generalization and specialization is critical for maintaining an efficient and normalized relational schema.*




## Managing Constraints and Complex Relationships

Complex relationships and constraints in the ER model, such as participation constraints, need careful consideration when translating to relational schemas. This ensures that the database enforces the required business rules.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- Participation constraints define whether all or only some instances of an entity participate in a relationship.
- Total participation may require the use of foreign key constraints that enforce the presence of related records.
- Partial participation allows some flexibility, with foreign keys being optional in certain contexts.
- Complex relationships, such as ternary relationships, require careful schema design to maintain integrity.
- Constraints like UNIQUE and NOT NULL enforce the rules defined in the ER model.
- Implementing these correctly is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the relational schema.

*Carefully managing constraints and complex relationships ensures that the relational schema accurately reflects the rules of the ER model.*




## Summary of ER to Relational Schema Translation

Translating ER models to relational schemas involves careful mapping of entities, relationships, and attributes into tables, keys, and constraints. This process ensures that the database accurately reflects the design intent of the ER model.

:::: {.columns}
