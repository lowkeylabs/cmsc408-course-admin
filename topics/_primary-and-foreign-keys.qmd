* Primary and Foreign Keys are known as "integrity constraints"
* They provide clues to the DBMS about how to handle relationships
between records in different tables.
* They are checked when records are added, deleted and updated

## [Foreign Keys](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-foreign-key/)

MySQL has five reference options: CASCADE, SET NULL, NO ACTION, RESTRICT, and SET DEFAULT.

CASCADE
: if a row from the parent table is deleted or updated, the values of the matching rows in the child table are automatically deleted or updated.

SET NULL
: if a row from the parent table is deleted or updated, the values of the foreign key column (or columns) in the child table are set to NULL.

RESTRICT
: if a row from the parent table has a matching row in the child table, MySQL rejects deleting or updating rows in the parent table.

NO ACTION
: is the same as RESTRICT.

SET DEFAULT
: is recognized by the MySQL parser. However, this action is rejected by both InnoDB and NDB tables.
