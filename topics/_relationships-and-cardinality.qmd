# Relationships and Cardinality



## Understanding Relationships in Databases

Relationships connect entities in a database, defining how data points relate to one another. These connections are fundamental to structuring data meaningfully.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- Relationships link two or more entities together in a database.
- They describe how entities are associated with one another.
- Examples include a student enrolled in a course or a customer placing an order.
- Relationships can involve two entities (binary), three entities (ternary), or more.
- They help establish connections between different tables in a relational database.

## Types of Relationships: One-to-One

One-to-one relationships link one instance of an entity to one instance of another entity. This type of relationship is relatively rare in database design.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- A one-to-one relationship exists when a single instance of one entity is associated with a single instance of another.
- Examples include a person and their social security number or a country and its capital city.
- These relationships can be mandatory or optional.
- In many cases, one-to-one relationships are combined into a single table.
- They simplify data retrieval by ensuring a direct link between two specific entities.

*One-to-one relationships provide direct connections between pairs of entities.*




## Types of Relationships: One-to-Many

One-to-many relationships are the most common type in database design, linking one entity to multiple instances of another entity.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- A one-to-many relationship occurs when a single instance of one entity is associated with multiple instances of another.
- Examples include a teacher and the students they teach or a department and its employees.
- These relationships are depicted with a single line connecting the "one" side to multiple lines on the "many" side.
- The "one" side often contains a foreign key that points to the primary key on the "many" side.
- One-to-many relationships organize data hierarchically and are essential for relational databases.
:::
::: {.column width=5%}

:::
::::

*One-to-many relationships structure data so that a single entity can relate to multiple others.*




## Types of Relationships: Many-to-Many

Many-to-many relationships occur when multiple instances of one entity are related to multiple instances of another entity, necessitating an associative entity to manage the relationship.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- A many-to-many relationship links multiple instances of one entity to multiple instances of another.
- Examples include students enrolled in multiple courses or customers purchasing multiple products.
- These relationships require a junction or associative table to handle the connections.
- The associative table contains foreign keys referencing the primary keys of the related entities.
- Many-to-many relationships allow for flexible and complex data connections within a database.

*Many-to-many relationships are crucial for managing complex associations between entities.*




## Cardinality: Defining Relationship Multiplicity

Cardinality defines the number of instances of one entity that can be associated with instances of another entity, playing a critical role in relationship modeling.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- Cardinality specifies the number of instances of an entity that can participate in a relationship.
- It is expressed as one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.
- Cardinality constraints help enforce data integrity and structure.
- They are depicted in ER diagrams using various notations, such as lines and symbols.
- Understanding cardinality is essential for accurately modeling database relationships.

*Cardinality defines the limits and scope of relationships in database design.*








## Depicting Relationships in ER Diagrams

ER diagrams visually represent relationships between entities, using standardized symbols and notations to convey cardinality and participation constraints.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- ER diagrams use lines to depict relationships between entities.
- Cardinality is shown with symbols like "1" and "M" or crow’s foot notation.
- Participation constraints are indicated by solid or dashed lines.
- Chen’s notation uses diamonds for relationships, while Crow’s Foot uses simple lines.
- Accurate depiction of relationships in ER diagrams is crucial for effective database design.

## Mapping Relationships to Relational Tables

Mapping relationships from an ER model to a relational schema involves translating relationships into foreign keys, ensuring data integrity across tables.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- Relationships in an ER model are translated into foreign keys in the relational schema.
- One-to-one relationships often result in a foreign key in one table.
- One-to-many relationships map a primary key in the "one" side to a foreign key in the "many" side.
- Many-to-many relationships require a junction table with foreign keys referencing both entities.
- Proper mapping ensures the logical integrity and normalization of the database.

*Mapping relationships correctly is key to creating a well-structured relational database.*




## Examples of Common Relationships in Databases

Examples of real-world relationships illustrate how different entities are connected in databases, helping students understand the application of these concepts.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- A customer placing multiple orders (one-to-many relationship).
- Students enrolling in multiple courses (many-to-many relationship).
- An employee having one unique ID number (one-to-one relationship).
- A book being published by multiple authors (many-to-many relationship).
- A department managing several employees (one-to-many relationship).

## Common Pitfalls in Modeling Relationships

Mistakes in modeling relationships can lead to inefficient or incorrect database designs, so understanding these pitfalls is essential for effective database modeling.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=95%}

- Failing to identify the correct cardinality between entities.
- Overcomplicating relationships with unnecessary entities or attributes.
- Ignoring participation constraints, leading to data integrity issues.
- Misusing one-to-one relationships when one-to-many would suffice.
- Overlooking the need for junction tables in many-to-many relationships.
