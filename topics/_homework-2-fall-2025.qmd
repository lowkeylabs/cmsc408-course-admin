### Worked example: Comic Book Management System  
Consider a comic book store that wants to manage comic books, authors, and customers. Each comic book has a comic ID, title, genre, and publication date. Authors have an author ID, name, and biography. Customers have a customer ID, name, and contact information. A comic book can be written by multiple authors, and each author can contribute to multiple comic books. A customer can purchase multiple comic books, and each purchase involves a single customer and one or more comic books. Purchases have a purchase ID, date, and total amount.
