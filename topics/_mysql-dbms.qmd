###  Leveraging the power

What not simply use 2-D arrays or other data structures in our programs? Why use a data base at all?

* The DBMS will DO LOTS OF WORK for us AUTOMATICALLY.
We simply need to know how to tell it what we want it to do.

* We can provide these management and operating rules when tables are created.

* The DBMS will enforce the rules in real-time behind the scenes.

* The DBMS maintains several databases specifically
for the management of the database itself!
