## Issue - VS code is blocking extensions

### Where are all my cool features?
* VS code will only enable extensions in approved directories.
* If you're editing a QMD and you see `plain text` you need to fix things.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
### Click on *Manage*

* Add your project folder to list OR
* Add your project folder PARENT to list.

## Issue - Why is this so hard?

### Oh ... will the pain ever end?

* YES - it will, I promise!
* You only need to install and debug the tools once.
* We'll use them throughout the rest of the term.
* Hopefully, you'll learn a bit more so that you 
can fix things in the future.

## Issue - So many environments!

:::: {.columns}

### I followed your directions!!!

* YES - I DID properly install pyenv and poetry.
* YES - I DID properly select python.
* YES - I DID install Quarto.
* YES - I DID update VS code.
* YES - I DID run it from the terminal OK.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
### BUT, why does it still NOT work???

### Relax, it's a feature - not a bug!

* Child programs are isolated from parent programs to protect parent program
from crashes.
* When the kernel starts a child program, the child gets an environment.
* An environment is a shared piece of memory, with key=value pairs.
* Child programs are given *copies* of their parent's environment.
* Sometimes the child isn't given what you want them to get.
* It all depends on your parent program, that is, how you start VS code, quarto and python.

## Issue - Wrong environments

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=60%}
![](./assets/env-wrong-environments ){fig-align="center" width=410px .lightbox}
:::
::: {.column width=40%}
### Look at all those things!
* Each window is a separate program
* Each gets it's own environment
* If you start vs code from a terminal they all get VS code
* If you run VS code from the GUI you get the GUI environment
<p>&nbsp;</p>
### To fix: click on python version

* Click on the version and select the correct environment.
