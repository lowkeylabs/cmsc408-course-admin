*Invest the time to get comfy with the CLI!* Direct use of the command line will save you *tons* of confusion in the long run!

## Homework 1 - Quarto and rendering

Quarto is a *document compiler*, MUCH like compiling a source file to create an executable file.  Quarto is a wrapper around *Jupyter* and *Pandoc*.

![](assets/quarto-qmd-how-it-works.png)

For this assignment, you'll be modifying an existing *qmd* file, adding your content, rendering the qmd to html and uploading the HTML to Canvas.

::: {.callout-tip}
I definitely recommend the [Quarto getting started tutorial](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/vscode.html)!  Don't forget to *render* the samples I provide in the *repository*.
