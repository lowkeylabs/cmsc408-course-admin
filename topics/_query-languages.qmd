### Relational Algebra

- Expressions are applied as a series of
steps to achieve a specific result.
- The order of the steps matters.

### Relational Calculus

- Non-procedural.  Tells you what the result
should be without providing steps
- Can be converted to relational algebra

### SQL

- A modified, practical implementation of Relational Algebra.
- Not exact, but close enough and VERY useful!
