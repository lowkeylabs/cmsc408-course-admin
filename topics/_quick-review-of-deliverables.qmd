## Project deliverable 3 - video proposal



- Easiest may be to record in ZOOM

- LOG IN to zoom using SSO and your VCU account

- If your video isn't saved, then manually move it to Kaltura

- Submit the Kaltura URL to Canvas.

- I'm experimenting with peer review.  You'll get to see and comment on videos from other students.
