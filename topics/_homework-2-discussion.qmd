### Overview



Homeworks 2 and 3 both focus on ER diagramming and report writing.



Homework 2 is *mostly* about getting everything

installed and running. The majority of the points are awarded

for simply making the tools work. Why *do it for free* when you can

earn points towards the final grade!



See the rubric on the main homework page for details on how the assignment will be scored.

## Quarto and rendering



This figure presents a high-level quarto workflow.

For homework 2, using quarto to render *qmd* files to markdown *md* files. We'll use GITHUB *present* the *md* files in a pretty way.



In later assignments, we'll use quarto to render further down the pipeline, from *qmd* to *html*, *pptx*, or *pdf*.



As an example, homework 1 provides a *qmd* file to be rendered to *html*.  Give it a whirl!
