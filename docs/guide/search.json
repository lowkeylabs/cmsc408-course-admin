    "text": "Combining Selection and Projection\nIn real-world queries, selection and projection are often combined to both filter and reduce data. This allows for more refined and efficient query results.\nIn relational algebra operations can be chained, that is, the results from one operation can be directly used inside another operation.\n\n\nSuppose we have a relation Students(Name, Grade).\nQuery: Π(Name)(σ(Grade &gt; 75)(Students)).\nThe result includes only the names of students with grades above 75.\nCombining operations allows for more complex and specific queries.\nSelection and projection together form the backbone of query design.\n\n\n\n\nRelational operations are ordered from the inside to the outside.\nGiven this query: Π(Name)(σ(Grade &gt; 75)(Students))\n\nFirst, the selection operation is performed, resulting in a subset of the original relation,\nthen, the projection operation is performed, reducing the number of columns in the result.\n\n\n\nCombining operations enables precise and targeted query results in relational databases.\n\nCombined Example 1\n\nGiven Students( ID,Name,Major,GPA,Grad_Year):\n\n\n\n   \n      \n         \n\n\n\nID\nName\nMajor\nGPA\nGrad_Year\n\n\n\n\nV10101\nAlice\nCS\n3.5\n2024\n\n\nV10102\nBob\nMath\n3.8\n2023\n\n\nV10103\nCarol\nCS\n3.2\n2025\n\n\nV10104\nDave\nPhysics\n3.9\n2023\n\n\n\n\n      \n   \n\n\n\n\nFind the Names and GPAs of all students who are expected to graduate in 2023.\n\n\n\n   \n      \n         \n\n\n\nID\nName\nMajor\nGPA\nGrad_Year\n\n\n\n\nV10101\nAlice\nCS\n3.5\n2024\n\n\nV10102\nBob\nMath\n3.8\n2023\n\n\nV10103\nCarol\nCS\n3.2\n2025\n\n\nV10104\nDave\nPhysics\n3.9\n2023\n\n\n\n\n      \n   \n\n\n\n\n\nCombined Example 2\n\nGiven Students( ID,Name,Major,GPA,Grad_Year):\n\n\n\n   \n      \n         \n\n\n\nID\nName\nMajor\nGPA\nGrad_Year\n\n\n\n\nV10101\nAlice\nCS\n3.5\n2024\n\n\nV10102\nBob\nMath\n3.8\n2023\n\n\nV10103\nCarol\nCS\n3.2\n2025\n\n\nV10104\nDave\nPhysics\n3.9\n2023\n\n\n\n\n      \n   \n\n\n\n\nFind the majors of all students with a GPA greater than 3.5\n\n\n\n   \n      \n         \n\n\n\nID\nName\nMajor\nGPA\nGrad_Year\n\n\n\n\nV10101\nAlice\nCS\n3.5\n2024\n\n\nV10102\nBob\nMath\n3.8\n2023\n\n\nV10103\nCarol\nCS\n3.2\n2025\n\n\nV10104\nDave\nPhysics\n3.9\n2023\n\n\n\n\n      \n   \n\n\n\n\n\nCombined Example 3\n\nGiven Students( ID,Name,Major,GPA,Grad_Year):\n\n\n\n   \n      \n         \n\n\n\nID\nName\nMajor\nGPA\nGrad_Year\n\n\n\n\nV10101\nAlice\nCS\n3.5\n2024\n\n\nV10102\nBob\nMath\n3.8\n2023\n\n\nV10103\nCarol\nCS\n3.2\n2025\n\n\nV10104\nDave\nPhysics\n3.9\n2023\n\n\n\n\n      \n   \n\n\n\n\nFind the ID and Names of all students in computer science.\n\n\n\n   \n      \n         \n\n\n\nID\nName\nMajor\nGPA\nGrad_Year\n\n\n\n\nV10101\nAlice\nCS\n3.5\n2024\n\n\nV10102\nBob\nMath\n3.8\n2023\n\n\nV10103\nCarol\nCS\n3.2\n2025\n\n\nV10104\nDave\nPhysics\n3.9\n2023",

Below are examples of larger operations as applied in practice.\n\n\nExample: Generating a list of employees eligible for a bonus.\n\nSelection operation to filter eligible employees based on criteria (e.g., performance).\nProjection to display only relevant fields (e.g., Name, Department).\nUnion to combine results from different departments.\n\nExample: Generating a report of products sold by specific vendors.\n\nSelection to filter products by vendor ID.\nProjection to display product name and vendor details.\nCartesian product to cross-reference products with vendor data.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Compiling a list of employees not assigned to any projects.\n\nAnti-join to find employees not in the project assignment table.\nProjection to show employee names and departments.\nSet difference to exclude employees with assignments from the employee list.\n\nExample: Producing a report of sales trends over time.\n\nSelection to filter sales data by date range.\nAggregation to calculate sales totals by month or quarter.\nJoin to merge sales data with product or category details.\n\n\n\nNote that these examples introduce additional operators to complement the Selection, Projection and Union already discussed. That’s what we’ll discuss next!\nEach of these examples is considered a single query even though they contains multiple single relational operations.\nYour semester long project must document 20 unique queries. To accomplish this, you’ll need plenty of entities (tables).",
