## CMSC 408 - Statement on Generative AI

- Grades for the course are assigned based on YOUR work, not the work of
  chatgpt, bard or some other generative AI tool. Grades help YOU
  understand where you are on the journey towards mastery of any pile of
  material.

- Generative AI can be a real asset in computing. You don’t need to
  memorize syntax, or struggle to hunt around to find some arcane code
  necessary to make your program work. But remember, it is supposed to
  be YOUR program.

- Homework assignments are designed to give you practice using the tools
  to create programs. The focus of the homework assignments is on the
  higher level cognitive skills - designing, comparing, judging,
  analyzing, assessing. **Use of Generative AI IS permitted on homework
  assignments and the semester project**, in so much as it can help the
  coding go faster. YOU are responsible for the design and should be
  able to explain it to anyone that asks.

- Quizzes are designed to test your knowledge of the course material.
  **Use of Generative AI is NOT permitted on any of the quizzes.**

- See [this

## Advice from your peers

 

### From course evaluation responses, Fall 2023:

<div style="font-size: 125%; margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%; margin-top: 5%">

*Discuss the level of difficulty of this course, the pace of the course,
and the level of effort required to complete the work in this course.*

</div>

## Advice from your peers

<div class="columns">

<div class="column">

*This course is easy if you keep up with the work. Having assignments
due every week along with the semester-long project is a lot to take
on.*

 

*I think there is a lot of work involved with this course, but so long
as you stay on top of the assignments, you will be sucessful, as they
are not really difficult, more so there is just a large quantity of
them.*

 

*The course was definitely difficult if not well prepared but the
professor gives every single tool one needs to succeed. The pace was
perfect and there is nothing I would change about it.*

</div>

<div class="column">

*The pace was quick and the work was not easy. Each week the homework
presented new concepts that were progressively more difficult, and it
was very easy to fall behind. Not the class with the sort of work you
can leave till the last minute, minimum, a couple hours per assignment.*

 

*Lot of the material that was covered in this class was all very new to
me, but Professor Leonard designed the course in a way that wasn’t too
overwhelming. I felt like the pace of the course was just right. Even
the times I was falling behind a little bit, I was able to pick myself
back up pretty quickly since the deadlines weren’t super strict. *

</div>

</div>

## Advice from your peers

<div class="columns">

<div class="column">

*I found the course difficulty to be well balanced. If a student goes to
class, asks questions, and makes an effort to do their assignment they
should have no problem at all passing. The pace of the course was
perfect and allowed enough time for each unit to be processed before
moving on to the next one. *

 

*The workload for this course is very challenging to manage. Having to
create a whole database and then do weekly homework assignments is very
difficult.*

 

*This course required an intense amount of coding. However, given the
clear expectations and due dates, I was able to plan ahead to meet
deadlines. *

</div>

<div class="column">

*This course is pretty easy, but I don’t think it needs to be harder. It
takes not much effort but still I feel like I am very good with
databases, api’s, even better at using python. I am still not good at
writing queries though.*

 

*There is a large level of effort required to this course. Especially
towards the end of the semester the assignments and projects can be time
consuming. That being said the professor gives more than enough time to
complete them and he is very helpful if a section ends up being
confusing for the class.*

 

*This course was fairly difficult, but the professor made it very
doable. The course pace was good, except by the end of the semester the
pace gets really fast. 10/10 professor*

## Why not use spreadsheets?

### Spreadsheets DO work and they ARE viable!

<div class="columns">

<div class="column">

[Here is spreadsheet driven web
site](https://vcu-ssg.github.io/ssg-quarto-cmsc-courses/)

</div>

<div class="column">

[Here is the
spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qrN3L7eRLsM-aVMHYaLQN-FMYtrTJf0_h6dLKlUdPkk/edit#gid=107368023)

</div>

</div>

### On the surface spreadsheets share many common elements with databases

<div class="columns">

<div class="column">

### Entities

- *Worksheets* are *Tables*
- *Rows* are sometimes *Records*
- *Columns* are sometimes *Fields*
- *Workbooks* are *Databases* (collections of tables)

</div>

<div class="column">

### Operations

- find rows, insert rows, delete rows, update rows,
- add columns, remove columns
- create worksheets, delete worksheets
- create workbooks, delete workbooks

</div>

</div>

## Why not use spreadsheets?

- Suppose that to add a new person, you need to make changes to three
  tabs (e.g., ‘Personal Info,’ ‘Contact Info,’ and ‘Employment Info’).

  - *What happens if you are interrupted in the middle of the change and
    forget where you are? (Atomicity)*

- Imagine that one of the tabs in your spreadsheet has a formula that
  automatically updates totals or averages when new data are entered.

  - *What would happen if, during an update, the formula fails to
    recalculate properly? (Consistency)*

- Consider a scenario where two people are editing the spreadsheet at
  the same time, both trying to add new rows to the same tab.

  - *How might their changes conflict, and what issues could arise?
    (Isolation)*

- Suppose you have made all the necessary changes to add a new person in
  your spreadsheet and then your computer crashes before you can save
  the file.

  - *What happens to the changes? (Durability)*

## Why not use spreadsheets?

- Imagine your spreadsheet contains sensitive information, such as
  personal or financial data.

  - *What controls could you put in place to ensure that only authorized
    users can view or edit specific parts of the data (Security)*

- Imagine that your spreadsheet currently manages a few hundred rows of
  data.

  - *What would happen if you needed to scale this to millions of rows?
    How would performance be affected, and what challenges might you
    face in managing such large volumes of data? (Scalability)*

- Imagine that your spreadsheet contains phone numbers across different
  tabs.

  - *What would happen if a home phone number was changed on one tab but
    not another? (Normalization and redundancy)*

## On Line Transaction Processing (OLTP) databases

<div class="columns">

<div class="column" width="80%">

- This semester we’ll be exploring Relational, [On Line Transaction
  Processing
  (OLTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing)
  Database Management Systems (DBMS), like MySQL, Postgres, SQLITE,
  Oracle, DB2 and SQLServer.

- A [Database Management System
  (DBMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database#Database_management_system)
  is the software that enables users to define, create, manage, and
  interact with databases. It serves as an intermediary between the end
  users, applications, and the database, ensuring that data is
  organized, stored, retrieved, and modified efficiently and securely.

- [There are many ways to store data in a
  DBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_model).

- We’ll be focusing on the [*Relational*
  model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_model#Relational_model),
  where the DBMS stores entities and the relationships between these
  entities inside a single database (called a
  [schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema)).

- These databases bundle multiple changes to the database as a
  [transaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction).
  Transactions can be reviewed and rolled back (reversed).

- [ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation,
  durability)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) is a set of
  properties of transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite
  errors, power failures, and other mishaps.

- Changes to the database are communicated to the DBMS using a language
  called [*SQL*, a *structured query
  language*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL). How does one [pronounce
  SQL?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9C8PNX72Ms)

</div>

<div class="column" width="20%">

![](assets/oltp-snip.png)

</div>

</div>

## On Line Transaction Processing (OLTP) databases

<div class="columns">

<div class="column">

- **Fast Query Processing:** These databases prioritize quick query
  response times to ensure efficient and prompt processing of individual
  transactions, making them ideal for applications like banking,
  e-commerce, and order management systems.

- **High Transaction Volume:** OLTP databases are designed to handle a
  large number of short, atomic transactions, such as inserting,
  updating, or deleting records, which are typically initiated by
  end-users in real-time.

</div>

<div class="column">

- **Data Integrity and Consistency:** OLTP systems implement ACID
  (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties to ensure
  that all transactions are processed reliably, maintaining the
  integrity and consistency of the data even in the event of system
  failures.

- **Normalized Data Structure:** OLTP databases typically use a highly
  normalized schema to minimize data redundancy, optimize storage
  efficiency, and reduce the complexity of data manipulation during
  frequent transactions.

</div>

</div>

## CMSC 408 - in a nutshell

- We’ll apply *entity-relation* models to design and describe the
  contents of a database.

- We’ll apply *relational algebra* to formally describe how we query the
  database.

- We’ll apply *normalization* to ensure that we minimize redundant
  information in the database.

- We’ll tie everything together using SQL.
