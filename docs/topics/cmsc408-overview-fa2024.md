## Canvas is the OFFICIAL platform

<div class="more-separation">

- YOU are responsible for your own LEARNING. My role is GUIDE and
  CURATOR.

- WE are working together as a TEAM so that at completion of the course,
  you are comfortable with designing and building databases.

- ANYTHING posted to the course canvas is FAIR GAME to be tested. If I
  think it’s important enough to be shared as part of the course
  materials on Canvas, I believe that it’s important enough for you to
  be familiar with it and possibly tested on it.

- I will OFTEN not be able to cover all the material relevant to a
  specific topic in class. That does NOT mean that it isn’t important.
  Even if I don’t complete the lecture slides during a class session,
  you should be familiar with ALL the material in the slides. ANYTHING
  in the lecture slides is FAIR GAME for testing.

## Statement on Generative AI

- Grades for the course are assigned based on YOUR work, not the work of
  chatgpt, bard or some other generative AI tool. Grades help YOU
  understand where you are on the journey towards mastery of any pile of
  material.

- Generative AI can be a real asset in computing. You don’t need to
  memorize syntax, or struggle to hunt around to find some arcane code
  necessary to make your program work. But remember, it is supposed to
  be YOUR program.

- Homework assignments are designed to give you practice using the tools
  to create programs. The focus of the homework assignments is on the
  higher level cognitive skills - designing, comparing, judging,
  analyzing, assessing. **Use of Generative AI IS permitted on homework
  assignments and the semester project**, in so much as it can help the
  coding go faster. YOU are responsible for the design and should be
  able to explain it to anyone that asks.

- Quizzes are designed to test your knowledge of the course material.
  **Use of Generative AI is NOT permitted on any of the quizzes.**

### Homework Assignments

<div style="font-size:0.9em;">

Homework assignments are done individually. Homeworks will be
distributed using GITHUB classroom; a link will be provided in the
Canvas assignment page. Homework repos will be submitted to Gradescope.
Homework HTML reports will be submitted to Canvas. Rubrics will be
provided. *REVIEW EACH RUBRIC CAREFULLY!*

### Homework assignment policies

<div class="smaller">

- I observe [flexible deadlines](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1367855) for
  homework, NOT FOR QUIZZES OR DELIVERABLES!

- Each homework has a *timeliness* score in the rubric. *On-time* gets
  full credit. The *timeliness score* is reduced slowly past the
  submission date.

- You will ALWAYS get credit for submitting assignments. ALWAYS turn
  something in! I want you to get the practice and LEARN!

- I realize this is NOT your only class. But don’t get too far behind!

- READ homework rubrics to see expectations for each assignment. The
  rubrics will help you understand what’s important and where you should
  spend your time.

- The homework assignments are generally aligned with the semester
  project, so that one reinforces the other. It pays to keep up!

### Quizzes

<div style="font-size:0.9em;">

Quizzes will be administered on-line using the Respondus lockdown
browser. It is the responsibility of the student to ensure that
Respondus works. Quizzes will be adminstered outside of class. NO LATE
QUIZZES.

Practice quizzes will be available. You can take practice quiz as many
times as you like. Practice quiz will look exactly like the actual quiz.
Expect each quiz to take 30-minutes or less.

### Semester-long project

<div style="font-size:0.9em;">

Students will work in teams of 2 on a semester-long project. The project
will require the students design, build and deploy a database driven web
application. *Team Update* deliverables are brief surveys reflecting on
project status, and should only take about 5-min to complete.

## Advice from your peers

 

### From course evaluation responses, Fall 2023:

<div style="font-size: 125%; margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%; margin-top: 5%">

*Discuss the level of difficulty of this course, the pace of the course,
and the level of effort required to complete the work in this course.*

</div>

## Advice from your peers

<div class="columns">

<div class="column">

*This course is easy if you keep up with the work. Having assignments
due every week along with the semester-long project is a lot to take
on.*

 

*I think there is a lot of work involved with this course, but so long
as you stay on top of the assignments, you will be sucessful, as they
are not really difficult, more so there is just a large quantity of
them.*

 

*The course was definitely difficult if not well prepared but the
professor gives every single tool one needs to succeed. The pace was
perfect and there is nothing I would change about it.*

</div>

<div class="column">

*The pace was quick and the work was not easy. Each week the homework
presented new concepts that were progressively more difficult, and it
was very easy to fall behind. Not the class with the sort of work you
can leave till the last minute, minimum, a couple hours per assignment.*

 

*Lot of the material that was covered in this class was all very new to
me, but Professor Leonard designed the course in a way that wasn’t too
overwhelming. I felt like the pace of the course was just right. Even
the times I was falling behind a little bit, I was able to pick myself
back up pretty quickly since the deadlines weren’t super strict. *

</div>

</div>

## Advice from your peers

<div class="columns">

<div class="column">

*I found the course difficulty to be well balanced. If a student goes to
class, asks questions, and makes an effort to do their assignment they
should have no problem at all passing. The pace of the course was
perfect and allowed enough time for each unit to be processed before
moving on to the next one. *

 

*The workload for this course is very challenging to manage. Having to
create a whole database and then do weekly homework assignments is very
difficult.*

 

*This course required an intense amount of coding. However, given the
clear expectations and due dates, I was able to plan ahead to meet
deadlines. *

</div>

<div class="column">

*This course is pretty easy, but I don’t think it needs to be harder. It
takes not much effort but still I feel like I am very good with
databases, api’s, even better at using python. I am still not good at
writing queries though.*

 

*There is a large level of effort required to this course. Especially
towards the end of the semester the assignments and projects can be time
consuming. That being said the professor gives more than enough time to
complete them and he is very helpful if a section ends up being
confusing for the class.*

 

*This course was fairly difficult, but the professor made it very
doable. The course pace was good, except by the end of the semester the
pace gets really fast. 10/10 professor*
